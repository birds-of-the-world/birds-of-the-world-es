<section id="sec-content-overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-content-overview">Overview</h2>
<p>BOW accounts are intended to provide comprehensive, up-to-date summaries of the known biology of all birds. The taxonomy of this series follows <a href="https://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/">eBird/Clements</a> and closely matches the North American and South American Classification and Nomenclature Committees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These accounts should be written so as to stimulate new studies by indicating gaps in our present knowledge of species. In other words, BOW accounts should be “one-stop shopping” for individuals who are seeking a summary of what we know—and don’t know—about a species’ biology and suggestions on where to go for further details (i.e., through the references cited). Accounts are geared toward ornithologists and those with advanced interests in bird biology. As a result, they should also prove useful to wildlife biologists, scientists in other disciplines who study birds, avocational enthusiasts interested in avian ecology and behavior, biology teachers and students, land managers, and researchers who assess environmental impacts, among others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contributors should aim to provide a critically compiled, accurate, and concise summary of present biological knowledge (and ignorance) of a species. Updated sections of accounts should be built upon sound, established published data and interpretations of those data, as supplemented with new unpublished data when available. Contributors should summarize key observations, findings, and conclusions from new (and newly found) studies. While lesser findings in publications may not be covered in any detail, contributors can alert readers to the existence of these findings (“Smith (2014) also provided information on…”) so that readers can seek such material on their own if desired.</p>
<p>In some cases, contributors will come across published summaries or reviews of some aspect of the biology of their species, e.g., diet or vocalizations. Whenever possible, contributors should summarize key aspects and details of these reviews and not simply point the reader to another source. In most situations, contributors should take it upon themselves to conduct their own independent review of studies that have been summarized and cite the original studies in their account. Note, <strong>all text must be original</strong>; contributors should be careful to avoid plagiarizing work (either others’ work or their own previously published work).</p>
<p>BOW content should be presented factually, objectively, and without bias, and authors should avoid imparting their personal opinions or interpretations. Rather, authors should present evidence-based information in such a way that readers have the necessary information to draw their own conclusions. Critiques of individuals, groups, groups of people, or specific studies (or similar) are not appropriate. BOW species accounts are generally not a venue for proposing new ideas; such ideas ought to appear and be judged first in the primary literature. However, as previously noted, contributors should highlight gaps in our knowledge. This includes not only pointing out data that are lacking but also raising as yet unanswered questions, such as unexplained structures or habits or deficient comparisons with related species. For topics about which little is known with certainty, contributors can state a probability, but this must be based on evidence; guessing should be avoided. When information is lacking, authors may include relevant information from closely related species. Make a special effort to report (or indicate ignorance about) habits and habitats used during the nonbreeding period, particularly for species that migrate to regions that are less well known. Try to relate different aspects of the species’ life history to each other, thereby characterizing the species’ distinctive qualities. Providing current and in-depth information, references, and research questions should be a powerful stimulus for new studies.</p>
<p>A revision should strive to be both readable and useful. Species accounts will be read widely and translated into other languages, so their content should be clear and avoid regionally specific language and references that may not be understood by a global audience. Since BOW revisions are no longer printed documents, there is no need to use the very concise, telegraphic language (and abbreviations) necessary in the original species accounts. Although there are exceptions, contributors should use complete sentences and think about flow, readability, and the best ways to convey the information. BOW will continue to use the scientific/technical language required to discuss ornithological information, but please avoid being overly wordy and instead convey the information succinctly. If there is a need to summarize highly detailed information, the text can be abbreviated and use incomplete sentences to be more efficient (e.g., paragraphs with extensive details or summary statistics, such as descriptions of plumages, molts, and biometrics on the Plumages, Molts, and Structure page).</p>
<p>We encourage contributors to think about ways to enliven the text of their accounts, especially in the Introduction. This may include incorporating historical and/or influential quotes, discussing the cultural significance of the species, and/or including brief amusing anecdotes.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-content-sources" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-content-sources">Sources of Information</h2>
<p>Plan to search widely for information to complete the revision. This includes reviewing not only recently published studies but also older publications, including those from the early 1900s and even before. Older literature that may have been difficult to identify or access when the original accounts were written may now be more widely available. Older publications often contain information on a species’ natural history of a kind that is rarely published these days. Such information can be invaluable in the present day in designing studies and interpreting results. Excellent places to find citations to, and PDFs of, older publications include Google Scholar: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/" class="uri">https://scholar.google.com/</a>, ResearchGate: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/" class="uri">https://www.researchgate.net/</a>, BioOne: <a href="https://bioone.org/" class="uri">https://bioone.org/</a>, Biodiversity Heritage Library: <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/" class="uri">https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/</a>, and SORA: <a href="https://sora.unm.edu/" class="uri">https://sora.unm.edu/</a>. Internet Archive (<a href="https://archive.org/" class="uri">https://archive.org/</a>) can be helpful for accessing older books. Zoological Record (<a href="https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-referencing/web-of-science/zoological-record/" class="uri">https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-referencing/web-of-science/zoological-record/</a>) can also be a helpful resource if your institution has a subscription.</p>
<p>Be sure to conduct searches using earlier versions of the species’ common and scientific names and/or names in other relevant languages. More and more, online searches will turn up accessible copies of older publications, e.g., at sites like Biodiversity Heritage Library: <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/" class="uri">https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/</a>. More recent publications can be identified using databases such as Scopus (<a href="https://www.scopus.com/" class="uri">https://www.scopus.com/</a>) and Web of Science (<a href="https://www.webofscience.com/" class="uri">https://www.webofscience.com/</a>). If contributors are unable to find a resource online, either BOW staff or the interlibrary loan specialists at an author’s home institution may be able to locate it. Such librarians can be remarkably helpful and should, of course, be included in the Acknowledgments.</p>
<p>Sources of information should include <em>all</em> the published literature, including not only peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals but also books, book chapters, unpublished theses and dissertations (increasingly available online), and state, provincial, and federal government reports. Take special care to minimize regional biases, particularly for species that were originally included in BNA accounts, as older international literature may be absent from these accounts due to the geographic focus of their original series.</p>
<p>For certain sections of the account, contributors will also want to include information from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, eBird, and Christmas Bird Count. Contributors should also examine field guides and other “<em>Birds of…</em>”–type books specific to states, provinces, and regions and, especially, most recent editions of state and provincial breeding bird atlases, many of which are available online. Nest record card databases can also be a source of information. In some situations, an examination of museum specimens can be helpful in completing certain parts of the account.</p>
<p>In some cases, novel information about a species (e.g., nest structure or dietary associations) can be inferred from media in the <a href="https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/">Macaulay Library</a> or other reputable archives (e.g., <a href="https://xeno-canto.org/">xeno-canto</a>, <a href="https://www.wikiaves.com.br/">Wikiaves</a>, or <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>). Whenever possible, BOW encourages contributors to submit these insights to peer-reviewed journals. Contributors may also include this information in BOW species accounts; however, the media and source archive must be properly attributed and cited (see <a href="#sec-content-grammar-references" class="quarto-xref"><span>References/Citations</span></a>). Note also that caution is warranted when trying to infer context from a media asset.</p>
<p>Similarly, contributors are welcome to include their own unpublished data in the account, although BOW encourages contributors to also consider publishing these data in peer-reviewed journals. If unpublished data are to be included in BOW, contributors should provide readers with some information on how the data were collected. Include results of statistical analyses of these data where appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contributors can also seek additional unpublished data from others but should take care to credit them appropriately. Including such data in a BOW species account does not preclude the owner from publishing them elsewhere at a later date. However, once these data are published, the citation in BOW should be updated.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-content-structure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-content-structure">Account Structure and Organization</h2>
<p>When published, BOW accounts will appear in one of two layouts: a vertically stacked layout most similar to the original layout of HBW accounts, or an expanded layout most similar to the original layout of BNA accounts. During a revision, you will have all sections available to you (as per the expanded layout), whether you choose to populate these sections or not. Any sections that do not have content will not be visible when the revision is published. When a revision is ready to publish, BOW staff will decide if the account contains enough information to be displayed in the expanded format. The ultimate goal is to have all BOW species converted to the expanded layout as information is populated.</p>
<p>Expanded BOW accounts are partitioned into <strong>pages</strong> by subject matter. The order of these pages is standard across all species (see below): following an Introduction page there is a page on Identification, then Plumages, Molts, and Structure; Systematics; Distribution; Habitat; etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within each page, there are a number of potential <strong>sections</strong>. For example, within the page on Systematics, there are sections on Geographic Variation, Subspecies, and Related Species.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within sections, there can be a number of designated <strong>subsections</strong>, each with its own heading. For example, within the Eggs section on the Breeding page, two common subsections that are typically treated separately are Shape and Size.</p>
<p>The order of standard account pages, sections, and subsections appears in <a href="https://birds-of-the-world.github.io/birds-of-the-world/app2.html">Appendix 2</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guidance for the appropriate content for each page and section appears in <a href="https://birds-of-the-world.github.io/birds-of-the-world/app3.html">Appendix 3</a>.</p>
<p>BOW strives to maintain consistency from account to account in content and organization as much as possible. Many researchers use these accounts to do comparative studies between species (e.g., molt patterns, types of food eaten, nest structure, egg size, or natal philopatry); as such, they search for specific information in the same location within a series of accounts. As a result, contributors should follow the guidelines of <a href="https://birds-of-the-world.github.io/birds-of-the-world/app2.html">Appendix 2</a> and <a href="https://birds-of-the-world.github.io/birds-of-the-world/app3.html">Appendix 3</a> as closely as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognize, however, that the biology of birds varies greatly from species to species. As such, there needs to be flexibility in the content of accounts. Exclusion of certain subsections is expected for some species (e.g., there would be no Timing and Routes of Migration subsection for a nonmigratory species).</p>
<p>BOW staff will consider the addition of new sections or subsections; however, the order of standard sections and subsections, as shown in <a href="https://birds-of-the-world.github.io/birds-of-the-world/app2.html">Appendix 2</a>, should be retained, even if author-created sections or subsections are interspersed among them. Any new sections or subsections should be proposed to BOW staff via the Draft Completion Form (<a href="https://forms.gle/e6uTR5E8Z5aXXc9n6">English</a>, <a href="https://forms.gle/4e3PifYqvKrbQ1tV8">Spanish</a>) or email. If adopted, changes will be enacted as per BOW site developers’ time frames.</p>
<p>Please note, any content imported from HBW is automatically added to the introductory section of each page (labeled with “(introduction)” in <a href="https://birds-of-the-world.github.io/birds-of-the-world/app2.html">Appendix 2</a>). This content should be parsed out into other sections and subsections, as appropriate.</p>

<section id="sec-content-grammar-grammar" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-content-grammar-grammar">Grammar, Punctuation, and Style</h3>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://birds-of-the-world.github.io/birds-of-the-world/app4.html">Appendix 4</a> for detailed information on grammar, punctuation, style, and formatting conventions.</p>
<p>Older accounts were written in a telegraphic style, and some sections (such as Plumages, Molts, Bare Parts, and Measurements) still call for a telegraphic presentation. With the transition to online publishing, there are no specific word limits or limits on the number of references used. Contributors should strive to be clear and concise and to use complete sentences wherever possible.</p>
<p>BOW species accounts are and will continue to be translated from English into multiple languages. BOW and <a href="https://www.deepl.com/">DeepL</a>, the translation service used by BOW, maintain a glossary to aid these translations. Nonetheless, contributors should aim to spell out words and abbreviate less (e.g., spell out months, states, and provinces) and avoid words or phrases that could be ambiguous or incorrect when translated. Bird names are inserted via a “species tag” (see <a href="edit.html#sec-edit-three" class="quarto-xref"><span>Step 3: Understanding the Editor Menu Bar</span></a>) and thus will change automatically with a user’s language preferences; however, tags cannot be automatically translated by DeepL, so contributors should take care to write about a species in the singular and avoid possessives whenever possible.</p>
<p>Note, however, that repeated use of longer words or terms (e.g., Endemic Bird Area [EBA] or Southeast Farallon Island [SEFI]) can become cumbersome for the reader. In such cases, terms should be defined at their first use in each section and may be abbreviated thereafter in that section (for short pages, the abbreviation may be defined just once per page). The same convention applies to scientific names.The main exceptions are measurements and statistics (m, km, min, yr, SD, p, CI, etc.), for which we use standard abbreviations that are not defined.</p>
<p>Please spell-check the manuscript as much as possible. The eBird/Clements Checklist is published in American English; thus, we ask that BOW accounts are written in American English for consistency (e.g., “gray,” not “grey,” and “molt,” not “moult”). Future site developments aim to enable authors to write in their preferred language.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-content-grammar-references" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-content-grammar-references">References/Citations</h3>
<p>Published BOW accounts use a numbered reference system in which citations are represented by numbers in parentheses in the appropriate place in the text. Contributors are expected to go through and add linked citations to the text (see <a href="edit.html#sec-edit-five" class="quarto-xref"><span>Step 5: Linking and Adding References</span></a>). Once a citation is linked within a section of an account, our system will automatically assign it a number, and the reference will automatically appear on the References page in the order in which it is cited in the text (or alphabetically, by option). Thus, there is no need for cross-checking the citations in the text against the References page.</p>
<p>When citing in the account text, please insert citations in parentheses and <strong>in chronological order</strong> with a comma and a space inserted between references, e.g., (Pyle 2017) or (Anderson et al.&nbsp;2009, Smith and Anderson 2014, Pyle 2017). Citations from the same year should be listed alphabetically. Generally, citing at the end of the sentence is preferred, unless the aim is to highlight the work of a particular author(s). Additional conventions regarding citations are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When citing observations/data of BOW account authors, please cite as:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>(J. Smith, personal observation) or (J. Smith, unpublished data)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For unpublished citations of people other than BOW account authors, please provide their full names in the Acknowledgments and cite in the main text as:&nbsp;
