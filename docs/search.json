    "text": "Versión 15: Actualizada en mayo de 2025\n\nPanorama general\nThank you for volunteering to work on a Birds of the World (BOW) species account! We aim to make BOW the singular source for the collected biology of all birds of the world. This dynamic platform is made possible by merging two of the Cornell Lab’s flagship publications, Birds of North America (BNA) and Neotropical Birds (NB), with content from the renowned Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW Alive) and Bird Families of the World, originally published by Lynx Edicions. BOW is supported with real-time data from eBird and multimedia from the Macaulay Library (which now has incorporated considerable material originally archived in the Internet Bird Collection).\nOur ultimate goal is to generate authoritative and comprehensive species accounts for each of the roughly 11,145 species of birds in the world. This guide will review the basics of revising a species account, with guidance on content, style, and format. All account revisions are expected to follow these guidelines closely for consistency, clarity, and efficiency.\nTo be involved with the BOW project, you must review and abide by the policies for authorship, conduct, and content outlined in Appendix 1. You will also need to complete a Contributor Information Form (English, Spanish). You should aim to resubmit this form every two years to maintain your status as an active contributor.\nIn a typical revision, BOW staff will grant you “author access” to a draft account that you will be able to revise on the BOW website without your changes becoming publicly viewable. This draft will contain whatever was present in the most recent version of the account. You and/or your team should combine, edit, or remove this content as you add your own new content to the account.\nWhen you have completed your revision, please fill out the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish). BOW staff will then review the account and may request clarification, formatting, additions, or other changes. BOW staff will also add media (images, sounds, and figures and associated captions) and will fully edit and format the account as necessary. Once that is done, you will have a defined Author Review period to make any final changes to the account before it is considered ready to be published. Please endeavor to provide any final feedback you might have within this time period; once it has elapsed, the account may be published whether or not BOW staff have final confirmation from you.\nDetails about every step of the process are included in this document. Thank you for your efforts to make BOW an authoritative and dynamic resource!\nLead Editorial Team: Shawn Billerman (smb223@cornell.edu), Brooke Keeney (bkk37@cornell.edu), Fernando Medrano (fm458@cornell.edu), Nicholas Sly (nds22@cornell.edu), Maria Smith (mgs248@cornell.edu)\nThe Cornell Lab of Ornithology (http://www.birds.cornell.edu/) sponsors the BOW series and holds the copyright.",

    "text": "To edit or review an account, you will be working with a draft account for your species that is not visible to the general public. The steps below are a quick guide to help you access and edit (if applicable) the draft for your account:\n\n\nNavigate to https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/home and sign into your Cornell Lab account (if prompted). You can verify that you are signed in if you see a black silhouette of a person in the upper right of the page followed by your name and username in parentheses. Note, this should be your individual username, NOT an institutional or group name/login.\n\n\nOnce signed in, use the species search field or the taxonomic list to navigate to the species account you will be working on. The initial “Introduction” page you see when you search for your account is the “live” version of the account. The live version is not editable. You will need to access the “draft” version of the account to see or make changes.\n\n\nTo open the draft of the account to review or edit, click the orange button that reads “Version: Live - X.Y” at the top of the screen (the version number depends on how many times the account’s citable content has been updated). Select the “Draft” option from the drop-down menu.\n\n\nYou should see an orange bar across the top of the screen that says “REVISION.” That indicates that you are looking at the draft.\n\n\nTo review an account: You can navigate between pages in draft mode by using the index of articles on the left-hand side of the page or the navigation buttons at the bottom of each page. Typically, only the lead author(s) of a revision can edit the text during review; other reviewers are asked to submit their feedback as a Word document or email to the BOW staff member coordinating the review.\n\n\nTo edit an account: Click the orange button that reads “Edit Revision” that appears at the upper right of the text that you would like to edit. This will open up an online editor window. Once you open the online editor, the editing tools will be displayed in a menu bar near the top of the screen in your browser. You can hover over any of the buttons for a brief description of their functionality.\n\n\nThe white text box below the editor menu bar will show the draft version of the text. You can modify this text as necessary without affecting what people see in the live online version of the account on BOW. You can verify that you are editing the draft of the account by checking that there is an orange oval beneath the species name in the upper left corner of the editor window that says “REVISION.” Be sure to save your work using the buttons at the upper right of the screen.\n\n\nOnce you start editing and saving your changes, the live site (what the public sees) will still show the old version of the account and its associated media, but the draft pages will show your updated text.\n\n\nPlease consult the full author instructions for additional details about accessing the system, formatting, style, and anything else relevant to revising or reviewing an account. If you need further help, or have any questions, please contact Brooke Keeney (bkk37@cornell.edu) or Maria Smith (mgs248@cornell.edu).",

If you don’t meet this requirement, or begin to feel lost trying to understand the code used in this guide, we suggest consulting one of the excellent free resources available online for learning R. For those with little or no prior programming experience, Hands-On Programming with R is an excellent introduction. For those with some familiarity with the basics of R that want to take their skills to the next level, we suggest R for Data Science as the best resource for learning how to work with data within R.\n\nTidyverse\nThroughout this guide, we use packages from the Tidyverse, an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. Packages such as ggplot2, for data visualization, and dplyr, for data manipulation, are two of the most well known Tidyverse packages; however, there are many more. In the following chapters, we often use Tidyverse functions without explanation. If you encounter a function you’re unfamiliar with, consult the documentation for help (e.g. ?mutate to see help for the dplyr function mutate()). More generally, the free online guide R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham is the best introduction to working with data in R using the Tidyverse.",

The free online book Geocomputation with R is a good resource on working with spatial data in R.\n\n\nSetup\n\nData package\nThe next two chapters of this guide focus on obtaining and preparing eBird data and environmental variables for the modeling that will occur in the remaining chapters. These steps can be time consuming and laborious. If you’d like to skip straight to the analysis, download this package of prepared data. Unzipping this file should produce two directories: data/ and data-raw/. Move both these directories so they are subdirectory of your RStudio project folder. This will allow you to jump right in to the modeling and ensure that you’re using exactly the same data as was used when creating this guide. This is a good option if you don’t have a fast enough internet connection to download the eBird data.\n\n\nSoftware\nThe examples throughout this website use the programming language R [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2023] to work with eBird data. If you don’t have R installed, download it now, if you already have R, there’s a good chance you have an outdated version, so update it to the latest version now. R is updated regularly, and it is important that you have the most recent version of R to avoid headaches when installing packages. We suggest checking every couple months to see if a new version has been released.\nWe strongly encourage R users to use RStudio. RStudio is not required to follow along with this guide; however, it will make your R experience significantly better. If you don’t have RStudio, download it now, if you already have it, update it because new versions with useful additional features are regularly released.\nDue to the large size of the eBird dataset, working with it requires the Unix command-line utility AWK. You won’t need to use AWK directly, since the R package auk does this hard work for you, but you do need AWK to be installed on your computer. Linux and Mac users should already have AWK installed on their machines; however, Windows user will need to install Cygwin to gain access to AWK. Cygwin is free software that allows Windows users to use Unix tools. Cygwin should be installed in the default location (C:/cygwin/bin/gawk.exe or C:/cygwin64/bin/gawk.exe) in order for everything to work correctly. Note: there’s no need to do anything at the “Select Utilities” screen, AWK will be installed by default.\n\n\nR packages\nThe examples in this guide use a variety of R packages for accessing eBird data, working with spatial data, data processing and manipulation, and model training. To install all the packages necessary to work through this guide, run the following code:\nNote that several of the spatial packages require dependencies. If installing these packages fails, consult the instructions for installing dependencies on the sf package website. Finally, ensure all R packages are updated to their most recent versions by clicking on the Update button on the Packages tab in RStudio.\n\n\neBird data access\nAccess to the eBird database is provided via the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) as tab-separated text files. To access the EBD, begin by creating an eBird account and signing in. Then visit the eBird Data Access page and fill out the data access request form. eBird data access is free for most uses; however, you will need to request access in order to download the EBD. Filling out the access request form allows eBird to keep track of the number of people using the data and obtain information on the applications for which the data are used.\nOnce you’ve been granted access to the EBD, you will be able to download either the entire eBird dataset or subsets for specific species, regions, or time periods. This is covered in more detail in the next chapter.\n\n\nGIS data\nThroughout this guide, we’ll be producing maps of species distributions. To provide context for these distributions, we’ll need GIS data for political boundaries. Natural Earth is the best source for a range of tightly integrated vector and raster GIS data for producing professional cartographic maps. The R package, rnaturalearth provides a convenient method for accessing these data from within R.\nThe data package mentioned in Data package contains a GeoPackage with all the necessary GIS data.",

It is assumed that contributors have read and will abide by these policies and have signed the BOW Contributor Agreement before beginning their revision.\nBOW contributors do not receive financial compensation for their work, although they do receive gratis access to BOW.\nFor an initial BOW revision, you will be given access to a draft account that contains text derived from the most recent BOW, Birds of North America (BNA), Neotropical Birds (NB), and/or Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW) species account (depending on your species’ geographic distribution). You can expect the following type of coverage from each original source:\nYou may edit, combine, or remove any or all of the existing text as you see fit as you populate new text and references into the account in the course of your revision.\nIf your account is for a species that was never covered by BNA or NB, the original HBW text will have been imported into the more comprehensive BNA/NB structure. When HBW text is present, it will have been imported into the first section of the page to which it correlates. Some of this text will likely be more appropriate in other sections or subsections, so we ask that you parse out whatever you choose to use into the most germane sections and subsections throughout the account (see Appendix 2). The HBW text may also include hyperlinks to images or other media originally from the Internet Bird Collection (or elsewhere). If these links are still functional, you may leave them in or remove them as you see fit. Please remove any broken links.\nPlease note, primary sources (i.e., the original published sources of information, often academic journal articles) are always preferred, and contributors should review original literature on the species to expand on, or replace, text from the above secondary sources (i.e., sources that contain information originally published elsewhere) to attain the appropriate level of detail in the account. Text originally derived from the HBW source project frequently did not contain references within the text. You should review the references (including the Additional References, which will contain HBW citations that are not referenced in the text) on the References page and, when possible and useful, ensure that those references are cited throughout the account’s text. See Account Content for further details on sources.\nA full revision will involve assessment of the entire account with updates across as many sections as appropriate, commensurate with the available publications on the species’ biology.\nA partial revision will involve a change to some of the citable content of an account without a comprehensive update to as many sections as possible. Some examples of partial revisions include an update of systematics/taxonomy, the addition of information from one or a few publications, and/or a revision of one or more sections by a specialist or BOW editor.",

    "text": "Visión general\nBOW accounts are intended to provide comprehensive, up-to-date summaries of the known biology of all birds. The taxonomy of this series follows eBird/Clements and closely matches the North American and South American Classification and Nomenclature Committees.\nThese accounts should be written so as to stimulate new studies by indicating gaps in our present knowledge of species. In other words, BOW accounts should be “one-stop shopping” for individuals who are seeking a summary of what we know—and don’t know—about a species’ biology and suggestions on where to go for further details (i.e., through the references cited). Accounts are geared toward ornithologists and those with advanced interests in bird biology. As a result, they should also prove useful to wildlife biologists, scientists in other disciplines who study birds, avocational enthusiasts interested in avian ecology and behavior, biology teachers and students, land managers, and researchers who assess environmental impacts, among others.\nContributors should aim to provide a critically compiled, accurate, and concise summary of present biological knowledge (and ignorance) of a species. Updated sections of accounts should be built upon sound, established published data and interpretations of those data, as supplemented with new unpublished data when available. Contributors should summarize key observations, findings, and conclusions from new (and newly found) studies. While lesser findings in publications may not be covered in any detail, contributors can alert readers to the existence of these findings (“Smith (2014) also provided information on…”) so that readers can seek such material on their own if desired.\nIn some cases, contributors will come across published summaries or reviews of some aspect of the biology of their species, e.g., diet or vocalizations. Whenever possible, contributors should summarize key aspects and details of these reviews and not simply point the reader to another source. In most situations, contributors should take it upon themselves to conduct their own independent review of studies that have been summarized and cite the original studies in their account. Note, all text must be original; contributors should be careful to avoid plagiarizing work (either others’ work or their own previously published work).\nBOW content should be presented factually, objectively, and without bias, and authors should avoid imparting their personal opinions or interpretations. Rather, authors should present evidence-based information in such a way that readers have the necessary information to draw their own conclusions. Critiques of individuals, groups, groups of people, or specific studies (or similar) are not appropriate. BOW species accounts are generally not a venue for proposing new ideas; such ideas ought to appear and be judged first in the primary literature. However, as previously noted, contributors should highlight gaps in our knowledge. This includes not only pointing out data that are lacking but also raising as yet unanswered questions, such as unexplained structures or habits or deficient comparisons with related species. For topics about which little is known with certainty, contributors can state a probability, but this must be based on evidence; guessing should be avoided. When information is lacking, authors may include relevant information from closely related species. Make a special effort to report (or indicate ignorance about) habits and habitats used during the nonbreeding period, particularly for species that migrate to regions that are less well known. Try to relate different aspects of the species’ life history to each other, thereby characterizing the species’ distinctive qualities. Providing current and in-depth information, references, and research questions should be a powerful stimulus for new studies.\nA revision should strive to be both readable and useful. Species accounts will be read widely and translated into other languages, so their content should be clear and avoid regionally specific language and references that may not be understood by a global audience. Since BOW revisions are no longer printed documents, there is no need to use the very concise, telegraphic language (and abbreviations) necessary in the original species accounts. Although there are exceptions, contributors should use complete sentences and think about flow, readability, and the best ways to convey the information. BOW will continue to use the scientific/technical language required to discuss ornithological information, but please avoid being overly wordy and instead convey the information succinctly. If there is a need to summarize highly detailed information, the text can be abbreviated and use incomplete sentences to be more efficient (e.g., paragraphs with extensive details or summary statistics, such as descriptions of plumages, molts, and biometrics on the Plumages, Molts, and Structure page).\nWe encourage contributors to think about ways to enliven the text of their accounts, especially in the Introduction. This may include incorporating historical and/or influential quotes, discussing the cultural significance of the species, and/or including brief amusing anecdotes.",

This includes reviewing not only recently published studies but also older publications, including those from the early 1900s and even before. Older literature that may have been difficult to identify or access when the original accounts were written may now be more widely available. Older publications often contain information on a species’ natural history of a kind that is rarely published these days. Such information can be invaluable in the present day in designing studies and interpreting results. Excellent places to find citations to, and PDFs of, older publications include Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/, ResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/, BioOne: https://bioone.org/, Biodiversity Heritage Library: https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/, and SORA: https://sora.unm.edu/. Internet Archive (https://archive.org/) can be helpful for accessing older books. Zoological Record (https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-referencing/web-of-science/zoological-record/) can also be a helpful resource if your institution has a subscription.\nBe sure to conduct searches using earlier versions of the species’ common and scientific names and/or names in other relevant languages. More and more, online searches will turn up accessible copies of older publications, e.g., at sites like Biodiversity Heritage Library: https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/. More recent publications can be identified using databases such as Scopus (https://www.scopus.com/) and Web of Science (https://www.webofscience.com/). If contributors are unable to find a resource online, either BOW staff or the interlibrary loan specialists at an author’s home institution may be able to locate it. Such librarians can be remarkably helpful and should, of course, be included in the Acknowledgments.\nSources of information should include all the published literature, including not only peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals but also books, book chapters, unpublished theses and dissertations (increasingly available online), and state, provincial, and federal government reports. Take special care to minimize regional biases, particularly for species that were originally included in BNA accounts, as older international literature may be absent from these accounts due to the geographic focus of their original series.\nFor certain sections of the account, contributors will also want to include information from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, eBird, and Christmas Bird Count. Contributors should also examine field guides and other “Birds of…”–type books specific to states, provinces, and regions and, especially, most recent editions of state and provincial breeding bird atlases, many of which are available online. Nest record card databases can also be a source of information. In some situations, an examination of museum specimens can be helpful in completing certain parts of the account.\nIn some cases, novel information about a species (e.g., nest structure or dietary associations) can be inferred from media in the Macaulay Library or other reputable archives (e.g., xeno-canto, Wikiaves, or iNaturalist). Whenever possible, BOW encourages contributors to submit these insights to peer-reviewed journals. Contributors may also include this information in BOW species accounts; however, the media and source archive must be properly attributed and cited (see Referencias/Citaciones). Note also that caution is warranted when trying to infer context from a media asset.\nSimilarly, contributors are welcome to include their own unpublished data in the account, although BOW encourages contributors to also consider publishing these data in peer-reviewed journals. If unpublished data are to be included in BOW, contributors should provide readers with some information on how the data were collected. Include results of statistical analyses of these data where appropriate. \nContributors can also seek additional unpublished data from others but should take care to credit them appropriately. Including such data in a BOW species account does not preclude the owner from publishing them elsewhere at a later date. However, once these data are published, the citation in BOW should be updated.",

    "text": "Estructura y organización de la ficha\nWhen published, BOW accounts will appear in one of two layouts: a vertically stacked layout most similar to the original layout of HBW accounts, or an expanded layout most similar to the original layout of BNA accounts. During a revision, you will have all sections available to you (as per the expanded layout), whether you choose to populate these sections or not. Any sections that do not have content will not be visible when the revision is published. When a revision is ready to publish, BOW staff will decide if the account contains enough information to be displayed in the expanded format. The ultimate goal is to have all BOW species converted to the expanded layout as information is populated.\nExpanded BOW accounts are partitioned into pages by subject matter. The order of these pages is standard across all species (see below): following an Introduction page there is a page on Identification, then Plumages, Molts, and Structure; Systematics; Distribution; Habitat; etc. \nWithin each page, there are a number of potential sections. For example, within the page on Systematics, there are sections on Geographic Variation, Subspecies, and Related Species. \nWithin sections, there can be a number of designated subsections, each with its own heading. For example, within the Eggs section on the Breeding page, two common subsections that are typically treated separately are Shape and Size.\nThe order of standard account pages, sections, and subsections appears in Appendix 2. \nGuidance for the appropriate content for each page and section appears in Appendix 3.\nBOW strives to maintain consistency from account to account in content and organization as much as possible. Many researchers use these accounts to do comparative studies between species (e.g., molt patterns, types of food eaten, nest structure, egg size, or natal philopatry); as such, they search for specific information in the same location within a series of accounts. As a result, contributors should follow the guidelines of Appendix 2 and Appendix 3 as closely as possible. \nWe recognize, however, that the biology of birds varies greatly from species to species. As such, there needs to be flexibility in the content of accounts. Exclusion of certain subsections is expected for some species (e.g., there would be no Timing and Routes of Migration subsection for a nonmigratory species).\nBOW staff will consider the addition of new sections or subsections; however, the order of standard sections and subsections, as shown in Appendix 2, should be retained, even if author-created sections or subsections are interspersed among them. Any new sections or subsections should be proposed to BOW staff via the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish) or email. If adopted, changes will be enacted as per BOW site developers’ time frames.\nPlease note, any content imported from HBW is automatically added to the introductory section of each page (labeled with “(introduction)” in Appendix 2). This content should be parsed out into other sections and subsections, as appropriate.",

    "section": "Gramática y formato",
    "text": "Gramática y formato\n\nGramática, puntuación y estilo\nRefer to Appendix 4 for detailed information on grammar, punctuation, style, and formatting conventions.\nOlder accounts were written in a telegraphic style, and some sections (such as Plumages, Molts, Bare Parts, and Measurements) still call for a telegraphic presentation. With the transition to online publishing, there are no specific word limits or limits on the number of references used. Contributors should strive to be clear and concise and to use complete sentences wherever possible.\nBOW species accounts are and will continue to be translated from English into multiple languages. BOW and DeepL, the translation service used by BOW, maintain a glossary to aid these translations. Nonetheless, contributors should aim to spell out words and abbreviate less (e.g., spell out months, states, and provinces) and avoid words or phrases that could be ambiguous or incorrect when translated. Bird names are inserted via a “species tag” (see Step 3: Understanding the Editor Menu Bar) and thus will change automatically with a user’s language preferences; however, tags cannot be automatically translated by DeepL, so contributors should take care to write about a species in the singular and avoid possessives whenever possible.\nNote, however, that repeated use of longer words or terms (e.g., Endemic Bird Area [EBA] or Southeast Farallon Island [SEFI]) can become cumbersome for the reader. In such cases, terms should be defined at their first use in each section and may be abbreviated thereafter in that section (for short pages, the abbreviation may be defined just once per page). The same convention applies to scientific names.The main exceptions are measurements and statistics (m, km, min, yr, SD, p, CI, etc.), for which we use standard abbreviations that are not defined.\nPlease spell-check the manuscript as much as possible. The eBird/Clements Checklist is published in American English; thus, we ask that BOW accounts are written in American English for consistency (e.g., “gray,” not “grey,” and “molt,” not “moult”). Future site developments aim to enable authors to write in their preferred language.\n\n\nReferencias/Citaciones\nPublished BOW accounts use a numbered reference system in which citations are represented by numbers in parentheses in the appropriate place in the text. Contributors are expected to go through and add linked citations to the text (see Step 5: Linking and Adding References). Once a citation is linked within a section of an account, our system will automatically assign it a number, and the reference will automatically appear on the References page in the order in which it is cited in the text (or alphabetically, by option). Thus, there is no need for cross-checking the citations in the text against the References page.\nWhen citing in the account text, please insert citations in parentheses and in chronological order with a comma and a space inserted between references, e.g., (Pyle 2017) or (Anderson et al. 2009, Smith and Anderson 2014, Pyle 2017). Citations from the same year should be listed alphabetically. Generally, citing at the end of the sentence is preferred, unless the aim is to highlight the work of a particular author(s). Additional conventions regarding citations are as follows:\n\nWhen citing observations/data of BOW account authors, please cite as: \n\n(J. Smith, personal observation) or (J. Smith, unpublished data)\n\nFor unpublished citations of people other than BOW account authors, please provide their full names in the Acknowledgments and cite in the main text as: \n\n(J. Smith, personal communication) or (J. Smith, unpublished data) \n\nWhen citing observations/data from a previous version of a BOW account from an individual who is no longer an author on the account, cite the previous version of the account and clearly credit the individual:\n\nR. E. Anderson found… (Jones et al. 1997)\n\nCiting articles as “in press” is acceptable, and these should be added as new references in the database. Please email us the full citation details once a paper has been published so that we can update the linked reference in the account.\n\n(Smith, in press) or (Smith et al., in press)\n\nNote: Manuscripts “in prep,” “in review,” or “submitted” should be cited in account text as “unpublished data” and should not be added to the reference database. \nWhen citing a specimen record, an eBird checklist, or a xeno-canto recording, please use the following format (note the hyperlinks):\n\nA female collected on 9 June had the bursa 4 × 2 mm and skull 50% ossified (University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute KU 131737).\nIn Halmahera, it also gives more downslurred buzzy shrills, each about 0.4–0.5 s, pitch ca. 6.0–7.2 kHz (M. Anderson, xeno-canto: XC497728).\nThere are two extralimital records. The first was an undocumented sighting record from Gili Trawangan (F. Dijkstra, eBird: S68127960).\nThe Chilean Pigeon has been observed bathing in shallow water (D. Ghigliotto, iNaturalist: 149930529).\n\n\nPlease see Appendix 4 and Appendix 5 for further details on style, formatting, and citations.",

    "text": "Español\nAntes de enviar el Formulario de finalización del primer borrador de ficha BOW (English, Español), por favor asegurarse de lo siguiente:\n\nSi se está completando una revisión completa, intentar incluir información en todas las secciones de la ficha (véase Appendix 2 para una lista de las secciones y Appendix 3 para una guía de cada sección).\nChequear las Referencias Adicionales, en la página de “References,” la cual podría tener artículos y otros que podrías haber omitido durante la búsqueda bibliográfica. Esto es especialmente para fichas del HBW, pues estas no incluían una revisión exhaustiva de la literatura.\nCitar todas las oraciones con un “reference tag” (véase Step 5: Linking and Adding References), o añada una nota de si la fuente es información no publicada, una observación personal, una comunicación personal, o una observación de eBird o similar (véase References/Citations).\n\nExcepción: Evitar usar referencias en la Introducción a menos que se esté incluyendo una cita textual o si no está incluido en otras secciones de la ficha.\nSi no hay información disponible sobre el tópico, añadir “Information needed.”\nSi estás preparando una revisión completa, pero no evaluarse una sección, por favor anotar “Esta sección no fue actualizada.”\n\nFormatear todas las referencias nuevas añadidas al estilo de BOW (véase Appendix 5). \nEscanee la Literatura Citada en la página de referencias para buscar referencias duplicadas (ordenar alfabéticamente es útil) y reemplace en el texto de la ficha para dejar solo una referencia (véase Step 5: Linking and Adding References).\nAsegurarse de que los títulos no están con negritas (e.g., texto formateado como Heading 1 o Heading 2).\nUsar “species tags” para todas las referencias a nombres de aves (véase Referring to Species).\n\nPara la especie focal, usar el nombre común solamente (excepto cuando se use el nombre científico sea útil, como en la sección de “Systematics”).\nPara especies que no sean la especie focal, proveer el nombre común y científico y linkear a la ficha BOW de esa especie la primera vez que la especie sea mencionada en cada sección. Para menciones subsecuentes de la especie en la misma sección, utilizar solamente el nombre común. Para páginas cortas, proveer el nombre científico solo la primera vez en toda la página (más que en cada sección).\n\nNo usar una s o ’s después de un “species” para dar un nombre plural o posesivo, respectivamente. Nuestro proceso de traducción automática no puede lidiar con esto. En vez de ello, replantee la oración para usar el nombre singular.\nAsegurarse que la especie focal es mencionada al inicio de cada página. Evitar iniciar una página o sección con “It,” pues debiese quedar claro que “it” se refiere a la especie focal.\nUsar minúsculas en nombres comunes de especies no aviares (pero colocar los nombres propios en general con mayúsculas, e.g., Central American, European).\nAsegurarse de que la primera sección de cada página (i.e., la sección que no tiene un título y que dice  “(introduction)” en el Appendix 2) provee un resumen general de la información de la página, sin repetir los detalles específicos. Evitar las citas en la sección, a menos que se provea información que no esté en otras partes de la página (aunque estos casos debiesen ser excepcionales).\nPara toda la información cuantitativa, especifique qué medidas son las que provee (e.g., mean, median, SD o SE) o el cómo la medida fue tomada (e.g., culmen expuesto). Cualquier número seguido de un símbolo “±” necesita ser especificado como SD o SE (e.g., 121.4 mm ± 1.02 SE). Si esta información no está reportada en la fuente original, indicar que no está especificada.\nVerifica que cualquier figura, media o tablas fueron preparadas con los estándares de BOW (véase Appendix 7). \n\nSi alguna parte del borrador fue publicada previamente en otro contexto, por favor asegurarse de tener permisos para republicarlos (e.g., figuras).\n\nChequear todos los enlaces y remover cualquiera que no esté funcionando actualmente.\nSeguir convenciones del American English para deletrear (e.g., “gray” en vez de “grey”) y puntuación (e.g., usar la “coma de Oxford”) (véase Appendix 4).\nUsar oraciones de un largo razonable, que permitan una lectura fácil.\nLeer el borrador, chequeando gramática, y que todas las referencias estén correctas.\nFinaliza el orden sugerido de la autoría (el cual será especificado en el Formulario).\nVerifica que todos los autores y autoras hayan enviado de forma reciente (en los últimos dos años) el acuerdo de contribución a Birds of the World.\nRellenar y enviar el Formulario de finalización del primer borrador de ficha BOW.",

Contributors will be asked on the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish) if they would like to use these experts’ services in their account. The work of these subject-matter experts may merit authorship, as per typical authorship policies, unless by prior agreement.\nBOW staff and contributors will be involved with the preparation of several elements of an account, which contributors will have the opportunity to review. Some elements that BOW staff frequently cover include: \n\nPhoto galleries and captions \nVideo galleries and captions (when applicable) \nPlumages, Molts, and Bare Parts\n\nIt is expected that contributors will review all contributions to the account prior to publication.

You can verify that you are signed in if you see a black icon of a person followed by your name (username) in the upper right of the page. Note, you may need to widen the size of your browser window if you are confident that you are signed in but do not see the icon.\nNote: If you are accessing BOW from a connection with automatic institutional access, you may be automatically signed into an institutional account and will not have the correct permissions to access the draft. To sign into your individual account, click on the person icon and select “Sign in as different user.” This should enable you to sign into your individual account.\nOnce you are signed in, enter the name of your species in the search box at the center left of the home page or at the upper left of a species page. You can use the common name (as per your user account’s language settings), scientific name, or four-letter alpha code for the species to search for the account.\nOn the Introduction page (or if you navigate to any other pages in the account), you will see a black bar that says “Version: Live - X.Y” at the top of the screen. Clicking on this button will pull up a drop-down menu with all active versions of the account (“Live” = what the public sees, and “Draft” = the draft that you will be working on, which is not publicly available). You should select the draft, which will be the highest numbered version available: the numbers denote the version of the account, which is correlated with a unique and citable DOI (see Paso 5: Enlazar y añadir referencias for a definition of “DOI”).\nOnce you have selected the draft version of the account, you will see an orange bar labeled “REVISION” at the top of each page of the account. You can click the “Edit Revision” button that appears at the upper right of each major section of text. This button will pull up an online editor from which you can edit the original text and build a draft account for your species.\nBe aware that each time you log back in to continue your revisions, your earlier work on a page or section will be visible only in the draft version of the account (not the live version).",

You can “hover” your cursor over any of the buttons for a brief description of their functionality.\nUnder the species name (at the top left of the screen) and next to the page name there should be an orange label that reads “REVISION.” This is your indication that you are editing the draft account.\nBelow is a series of screen captures that walks you through the functionality of the editor menu bar. In general, the editor menu buttons are standard, and they work the same as they might in most text editing software programs, such as Microsoft Word. Typical keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Control + V) also work, in addition to the button functions outlined below.\nLabeled in the image in red are the functions for the first five editor menu buttons:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two arrow buttons allow you to undo or redo your most recent change. The scissors icon allows you to cut highlighted text, while the two pages icon allows you to copy highlighted text, and the clipboard icon allows you to paste text.\nThe “Styles” drop-down menu allows you to format different levels of headings. Account subsection headings should be entered as “Heading 1” (do not bold manually), and any headings within those subsections should be entered as “Heading 2” (do not bold manually). See Appendix 2 for a list of pages, sections, and subsections.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext (in red) are buttons that allow you to bold text, italicize text, and format a scientific name or a vocalization. To use these buttons, highlight the text you would like to change, and then click the button corresponding to the change you would like to make. The italics, “Sci Name,” and “Vocalization” tags all give the same appearance (italicized text); however, the Sci Name and Vocalization buttons insert a hidden tag that allows our system to recognize the special formatting. In the future, this will allow the system to make automatic updates when taxonomy changes or to link up media.\n\nNote, you should use the Sci Name button only when italicizing genera, subspecies, and the scientific names of species other than birds. This may include discussions of historical taxonomy or subspecies taxonomy (e.g., “the subspecies flavicola”). The Species Name button (see below) should be used for all bird common names, scientific names, and binomials. For more information, see Referring to Species.\nPlease use the Vocalization button to italicize onomatopoeic vocalizations (e.g., “Chuk call”). Do not italicize descriptive vocalizations like “Alarm Call.”\n\nNext are buttons for subscript (e.g., x1) or superscript (e.g., km2). To use these buttons, use your cursor to highlight the character that will become the subscript or superscript, and then click the desired button. The Tx button removes any special formatting.\nThe chain link icon inserts a link to a URL. You may want to link to content elsewhere in the account or on an external website. To do this, use your cursor to highlight the word or phrase in the draft text that will anchor the link; click on the chain link icon (a short length of chain).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo insert a link to an external website, you will paste the URL of your destination into the URL box of the pop-up window and then click on the green “OK” button. Remember to always check the link to confirm that it is operational; you can do this after clicking “Save + View.” If the link needs to be removed or changed, just go back to the editor and right click on the blue (linked) text in the account. You can then click “Edit Link” or “Unlink” (or simply delete the linked text in the document).\nWhen inserting a link to a page or a section within an account (e.g., “see Demography and Populations: Population Status”), highlight the text in the draft to be linked, click on the chain link icon, and then click on the box labeled “Protocol” and select “&lt;other&gt;” (not “https://”). Specify the URL as simply its “PAGE#SECTION” portion. For example, “demography#popstat” (no spaces). You can determine how pages and sections are named in URLs by opening the account in a new tab and navigating to the relevant page or section using the links on the left side of the page. Copy the text after the final “/” in the URL and paste it into the box in the editor.\nWhen inserting a link to a specific page or a section within a different account, use protocol “&lt;other&gt;” (not “https://”) in the link tool and specify the URL as /bow/species/SPECIES_CODE/cur/PAGE#SECTION. For example, if you want to link to the Plumage section in the Red-throated Loon account, you will use: /bow/species/retloo/cur/appearance#plume\nYou can link only to pages or sections; if trying to link to a subsection, please link to the section that contains it, and leave the subsection unlinked.\nThe first time a bird genus or family is mentioned in a given section (or the first time it is used on a page if that page is short), please link to the relevant destination on BOW. Again, use the “&lt;other&gt;” protocol, and specify the URL as follows:\n\nFor a genus:\n\n/bow/species/gralla2/cur/species#genusGrallaria\nTo get the relevant text, go to the BOW account for any species in that genus. Click on the genus name near the top of the page. Use everything in the URL after the “.org”\n\nFor a family:\n\n/bow/species/gralla2/cur/introduction\nTo get the relevant text, search for the family in the BOW search bar and go to the relevant account. Use everything in the URL after the “.org”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Omega symbol (Ω) button provides access to special character menus. Clicking on the Ω button will bring up several menus of accented characters, mathematical symbols, etc. If you have trouble finding any symbols (e.g., ≤ ≥ ° ± × – —), we suggest that you copy/paste these from the internet or from Appendix 4.\nPlease DO NOT use the “Insert Table” button to insert a table at this time. Rather, follow the instructions for tables outlined in Appendix 7.\nThe next button allows for formatting of bullet points.\nTo search for or replace text in the text editor, click the magnifying glass icon. \nFinally, you should use the Species Name button when linking to a bird’s common or scientific name (or both). This button will insert a bird name as a “species tag” that will allow it to be displayed in different languages and facilitate automatic updates if the nomenclature changes. For more information on using the Species Name button and formatting for using species names in general, see Referring to Species.\n\nWarning: Species tags will retain the formatting of any replaced text (e.g., italics, Sci Name tags, bolding, or hyperlinks), so be sure to remove (unclick) any such formatting from the text you are replacing.\nThere may be cases when you do NOT want a species name to change with taxonomic changes (e.g., discussing the history of a name or taxon or discussing a subspecies). In these cases, the species name should be untagged (i.e., no species tag).\n\nThe “Media Link” and “Inline Media” buttons are intended for BOW curators, so please ignore these buttons. If you would like to include media in your draft, you can attach a Word document to the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish), or you can include Macaulay Library asset numbers in parentheses in the draft’s text itself. Refer to Appendix 7 for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last button (a page with arrows inside) allows you to view the HTML code for the text. You should not need to view the HTML under normal authoring circumstances.",

    "text": "Paso 4: Revisar el borrador de ficha\nYour draft account will contain the headings and all of the text that appeared in the most recent published version of the account. This content and structure may not align with current standards for BOW accounts, so be sure to compare what is in your draft with Appendix 2 and Appendix 3. \nWhen you are revising a draft account, you can modify the text, and/or add or subtract to/from it, as you add new text and references. Text from vertically stacked accounts (e.g., HBW accounts) will have been incorporated into BOW in its original form (i.e., unreferenced and in a single block of text that may correspond to several different sections/subsections in the BOW expanded account structure). You should read this text carefully and remove any inactive links. Whenever possible, you should replace this text with your own referenced summary of the primary literature. Do not assume that this text has been placed in the most appropriate section of the account: it may be that portions of that text correlate better to other sections or subsections of the account, and you should parse it out appropriately.\nWe recommend that you compose your draft directly in the text editor, but you can also cut and paste text into the editor from a Word document (or similar). Errors can be introduced during the “cut and paste” method, so we always suggest that you carefully review your work.\nBOW’s editing tools do not include a sophisticated spell-check feature, but when you are in edit mode and place the cursor in the text box, words that the text editor does not recognize are underlined in red. Most highlighted words are names that are unfamiliar to the text editor—scientific names, proper nouns (like names of authors or geographic features), etc.—but a careful perusal of flagged words often reveals an inadvertent typo. Unfortunately, this spell-check feature does not provide suggested alternative spellings—it falls on you to correct mistakes!\nSaving your work regularly and often is always a good idea! There are two ways to save your changes, which are denoted by the two blue buttons at the top right of the screen: “Save + View” and “Save.”\n“Save + View” allows you to save your work and then see how it appears in the draft account. Hitting this button will take you out of the editor and into the draft account. “Save” will save your work in the editor, but you will remain in the editing window. To exit the editor without saving any changes that you have made since the last save, click on the white “Cancel” button at the upper right of the toolbar. \nNote: The editor window will time out if left inactive for 60 minutes.\nIf you get an error message (“Sorry, you cannot access that page”) when trying to save your work, you have either hit the save button more than once, or another person might be editing the same section. When you get this message, if possible, you should copy your work to ensure that it is backed up. Alternately, to restore work that was not saved: (1) Click the orange “Sign In” button in the upper right corner. You should now see the editor window without your changes. (2) Click the “Back” button in your browser two times (not the back arrow in the editor window). You should now see the editor window with your unsaved changes restored. (3) Click “Save” immediately to save your work.\nYou can navigate between pages in revision mode by using the index of pages within the account on the left-hand side of the page or the navigation at the bottom of each page as long as you are actively working on the account. If you are logged out of BOW, you will see the “live” version of the text the next time you log in, and you will need to switch to viewing the revision again to see your revised text (see Paso 2: Acceder a la web de BOW).\nNote: Many aspects of a new version will not be finalized until after the Draft period. Media and figures are typically added to the draft during the Editorial Review period, and the account citation (which appears at the bottom of the screen) will not be fully updated from the previous version’s authorship until there is final consensus between the contributors and BOW staff on the authors and author order, usually during the Final Review period.",

    "text": "Paso 5: Enlazar y añadir referencias\nBefore working with citations and references, we strongly encourage contributors to view a recently published account to view how numbered citations and references now appear.\nTo add a linked reference to your text, place your cursor where you would like the reference to appear, or highlight the text you would like a linked reference to replace, and then click on the blue “References” option that appears in the upper right of the editor window.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will open a reference module (see below) to the right of the main editing window. First, it is helpful to check the references already cited in the account using the “Account” button. If you see your desired reference in that list, simply click on it to insert a “reference tag” in the text. This tag will show up as a yellow box with the first author’s surname and publication year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the reference you would like to cite has not already been included in the account, you can search for an existing reference in the BOW master bibliography using the “Author,” “Publish Year,” “Title and/or Book Title,” or “Journal” fields. Putting information into these fields will pull up references that match the information you have entered. Once you find the reference you would like to use, you can click on it to insert the reference tag into the text. Often, you will need to enter only the first author’s surname and year to find the reference you are seeking. Note that any diacritical marks used in the author’s name will need to be used in the search box, so you might want to copy the author’s name from the publication and paste it into the search box.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: BOW’s master bibliography includes references from the BNA, NB, and HBW projects. As such, some references might occur in the master bibliography multiple times. Please make sure that if you use a reference that has multiple entries in our database, you are consistent in using the same one throughout the account you are revising. You can check this by looking for duplicates in the Literature Cited section when ordered alphabetically. When a duplicate is found, insert the reference tag for the version that most closely matches BOW’s format (or, if format does not differ, the version with a DOI or URL) into the text, and then replace all instances of the duplicate with that tag. Please also remember to check the list of references already associated with an account before adding one from the master bibliography.\nIn addition to searching for references by the fields listed above, you can also view recently added references to the account by clicking “Recent.”\nNote that not all references in the reference database are in the format now being used in species accounts. BOW staff are working to standardize reference format across all accounts.\nIf you would like to add a reference that does not appear in the search, you can click “Create.”\nFirst, select the publication type you would like to enter (Journal Article, Book Chapter, Book, or Other). Then, fill out (or copy and paste into) the fields as they appear on the “Create new reference” form.\nFor the “Full reference” field, you will insert the reference into the text field. The citation you input into that field is what will appear in the bibliography. Do not insert DOI or URL information into this field (see below). Please follow the format outlined in Appendix 5 when adding references.\nMoving down, the text in the “Author Prefix” field will determine how the author names should appear in inline citations (e.g., Smith, Smith and Jones, or Smith et al.). Please do not use “&” in this field; spell out “and” instead.\nThe “Authors,” “Year published,” “Article title,” and “Journal title” fields will allow the reference you are creating to be searchable in our reference database by author name, year, title, and journal, respectively. \nYou are also asked to provide the “DOI” number. This is a unique alphanumeric string assigned with each publication that allows it to be identified on the internet. While it may take some time to locate the DOI for some publications, providing it will help ensure that reference is correct and accessible.\nIf the material you are referencing is published exclusively online and does not have a DOI or come from an established scientific journal (e.g., it is an organization’s webpage or an online report), please include the URL. If you have DOI, there is no need to enter a URL.\nOnce you have completed the “Create new reference” form, you will review the information you entered. If your reference is similar to another in our database, the system will ask if you are entering a duplicate. If the information is correct and the reference is unique, then click the blue “Save” button. The reference will appear in the account bibliography and will be available in the reference search for linking in the text. If the reference you entered is indeed a duplicate, please do not create another reference. You should use the existing reference and notify BOW staff if that reference needs to be reformatted.\nAs an author, you can edit or remove references that you (and only you) have added to the bibliographic database. To do this, navigate to the References page of the account. There, you will see links to edit any references you have created (see example in screenshot below). If the reference has not yet been used in the account, you will also see a link to remove the reference. Each reference cited in the text must be listed on the References page and vice versa. Please make a final check for any unused references when the draft is complete.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: You cannot edit references that you did not create. You may find existing references that are incorrect or incomplete. In these situations, you should collect your suggested edits into a Word document that you submit via the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish) or alert BOW staff, who will make the changes for you.",

    "text": "Paso 6: Revisión y publicación de la ficha\nOnce you have completely finished the revision, you should collect any supplementary materials you would like to include with your draft (e.g., media requests, map edits, figures, or tables) and then fill out the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish), which will help us collate information relating to your draft. Please make sure that you include any necessary edits to the map, as map revisions can take BOW staff some time.\nIt is not necessary to change the status of each section from “Draft” (in red) to “Editor Review” (in orange); once sections are in the “Editor Review” state, they cannot be edited, so a BOW editor will change the state when they begin their review, allowing you to continue to make final tweaks while the draft is awaiting review. \nWhen we receive your form, your account will go into a review queue until BOW editors are able to look over your work. BOW staff will review and edit the text as needed and will begin to add media (images, videos, sounds, and figures), tables, and any formatting that is necessary for final publication. If your account is to be externally reviewed, it will be sent out during this period. \nOnce the Editor Review period is completed, BOW staff will email you a summation of any significant changes that were made to the draft’s text, as well as any issues in the account that require clarification or additional work (e.g., format, references, or more content for a particular section). The Author Review will typically be a one-month period in which you will be able to make final changes to the account before it is published online. A slightly longer period may be allotted if your account received an external review or if there are more extensive comments to address. This final review period is not intended for lengthy drafting, and contributors are asked to please avoid making changes to formatting (but please let us know if you have questions or note an inconsistency).\nDuring the Author Review period, all authors should read over the BOW editor’s comments, make any relevant changes, review the account in its entirety, and verify that the format and spelling of their name (e.g., initials to include) are displayed correctly in the citation. If you would like more time for review, please alert BOW staff as soon as possible. If BOW staff are not able to communicate with you, they will assume you will not participate in the review process further and will proceed with the draft’s publication. Any edits or feedback you submit after publication may still be incorporated into the account, although extensive changes may necessitate a new version.\nOnce your account is published, we encourage you to submit any additional minor edits or corrections by emailing Brooke Keeney (bkk37@cornell.edu) or Maria Smith (mgs248@cornell.edu).\nFinally, if you have questions about formatting or the best way to proceed with anything from a technical standpoint, please contact Brooke Keeney (bkk37@cornell.edu) or Maria Smith (mgs248@cornell.edu).\nThank you for all of your work! We look forward to your revision!",

    "text": "1. Historial de versiones y revisiones\nBirds of the World (BOW) species accounts are “living” and versioned documents that are intended to be regularly updated to incorporate new information and correct errors. BOW strives to enact account revisions and assign authorship as fairly and accurately as possible. This document (Appendix 1) is intended to define the policies and procedures of BOW content generation and the expectations of BOW contributors. To ensure fair and appropriate recognition of contributors and consistency over the years, BOW contributors and staff will adhere to the following guidelines to the maximum extent possible:\nTo ensure that each account’s content can be cited accurately over time, species accounts are given a new “version number” and a unique Digital Object Identifier (DOI) every time their citable content (i.e., text and references) changes.\nAccounts are versioned by number and source project (BNA, BOW, HBW, or NB), with the oldest versions corresponding to the lowest numbers. A full revision, i.e., an update to the majority of an account’s sections, corresponds to a “major” number change (e.g., from version 1.0 to 2.0 or version 1.1 to 2.0). A partial update (i.e., a noncomprehensive update affecting some but not most of an account’s sections) would correspond to a “minor” number change (e.g., from 2.0 to 2.1).\nOther changes that correspond to a minor number change can include a change in a species’ name (common or scientific) or higher classification or a change in the project to which an account belongs (e.g., BOW accounts are distinctly citable relative to accounts authored as part of the BNA, HBW, and NB projects), even if the content itself has not been changed significantly.\nVersion numbers do not change when BOW staff or contributors correct typos, update links, or make other small edits or changes. Maps, media, and changes in eBird-related products, such as Status and Trends visualizations or eBird occurrence maps (“purple maps”), are also not subject to versioning.\nEach BOW species account has a Revision History page that contains a stable archive of every version of an account. When available, each version has (1) a recommended citation with a version number and DOI, (2) a brief description of the changes from the previous version and (as appropriate) the names of the people involved in that version, and (3) a link to access that version as it was at the time of its publication.",

    "section": "2. Políticas de autoría",
    "text": "2. Políticas de autoría\nAuthorship of BOW accounts is determined by the relative cumulative contribution of each contributor to a given version, unless the contributor team and BOW staff jointly agree to an alternative arrangement. This policy ensures fair recognition of scholarly work while maintaining flexibility for special circumstances.\nA contributor’s “cumulative contribution” encompasses both new content added to a version and any retained content from previous versions attributed to them. Contributors with the most substantial cumulative content will be listed first in the citation. Those with more modest contributions may appear later in the author list or, if their contributions fail to rise to the level of authorship, may be acknowledged in the account’s Revision Notes. Previous authors and deceased authors will retain authorship on new versions provided enough of their attributed content remains.\nAll contributors to a new version should agree on a preliminary author sequence early in the revision process, understanding that this order may require adjustment as work progresses to reflect actual contributions. In cases where contributors cannot reach consensus on authorship order, BOW staff will mediate the situation through consultation with all parties involved.\nWhen submitting a revision for editorial review, contributors must review these authorship policies (Appendix 1) and indicate their proposed author sequence on the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish). While BOW staff hold the ultimate authority in determining authorship and citation order, they will carefully consider contributors’ suggestions and discuss any proposed changes with affected parties. Editors strive to apply authorship criteria consistently and fairly across all accounts.\nWhen cumulative contributions cannot be clearly differentiated, BOW staff may sequence author names in the citation in alphabetical order or, for sectional contributors, in the order their content appears in the account, unless alternative arrangements are mutually agreed upon.\nAn account may incorporate text from multiple contributors over time. Authors may be removed from the author list either at their request or if editors determine that insufficient attributed content remains in the current version. However, original published versions and their authorship will be preserved in the Revision History. Contributors must specify on the Contributor Information Form (English, Spanish) if they wish to be notified of authorship changes.\nWhen unpublished data or observations from previous authors are retained in new versions, these should be cited appropriately with reference to the previous account. For example: “Anderson in Jones and Anderson (1998).” Such contributions will be preserved in the Account History and can be noted in the Acknowledgments section.\nTo maintain authorship status, authors are encouraged to actively participate in updates to their work over multiple versions. Engaged contributors in good standing can consult with BOW staff regarding the timing and implementation of future updates to their accounts.",

    "text": "3. Mantener el estatus de “autor activo”\nBeginning in 2025, contributors must review and renew their Contributor Information Form (English, Spanish) and associated Contributor Agreement every two years to maintain “active” contributor status. Active contributors can consult on how and when their work is updated, and BOW editors will make every reasonable effort to accommodate their preferences and facilitate their continued involvement with the project. \nThis requirement ensures current contact information and continued engagement with the BOW project. Contributors who become “inactive” may forfeit their ability to influence revision timing and implementation, and BOW staff will no longer be obligated to contact them.\nContributors should clearly indicate their preferred contact methods and desired level of involvement on the Contributor Information Form. While BOW staff will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate these preferences, they reserve the right to override preferences that unnecessarily impede account updates or conflict with BOW’s goals and ethical standards.\nWhen contacting contributors who have requested notification, BOW staff will use the provided contact information. If no response is received within two weeks, staff will proceed with identifying alternative contributors for a species account. A simple acknowledgment of communication is sufficient to maintain active status.\nActive status may be lost if:\n\nThe Contributor Information Form expires without renewal\nCommunications from BOW staff go unanswered for more than two weeks\nNo meaningful progress is shown on drafts for one year\nProfessional conduct standards are violated\n\nWhile all contributors in good standing are always welcome to be involved with their work regardless of active status, those who become inactive will not be consulted regarding revisions and are expected to collaborate constructively with any new updates or contributors appointed during their inactivity.",

Plagiarism, copyright violations, or the use of content that has been generated via artificial intelligence (AI) are not permissible (also see the BOW AI Policy). Content should be objective and unbiased and should rely upon published information whenever possible.\nBOW maintains strict ethical standards and has zero tolerance for:\n\ndiscriminatory content or behavior based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, etc. \nscientific misconduct, including data fabrication or manipulation, plagiarism, or intellectual property violations\nharassment, hostility, or retaliation against contributors or staff\nconflicts of interest that are not properly disclosed\nethical violations in research methods or personal conduct\ncultural insensitivity in describing indigenous knowledge or practices \n\nNote that plagiarism herein is defined as the usage of uncredited, derivative content. All text should be in your own, original words, and any text taken directly from another source, including text that you wrote in other citable contexts, should be placed within quotation marks. All information that originated from another source must be cited (see Referencias/Citaciones and Appendix 5).\nBy participating in the BOW project, contributors assert that their content and behavior abide by these standards and that their content is the original work of the attributed contributors. Violations may result in immediate termination of participation and removal of content. BOW staff will investigate any concerns promptly and thoroughly.\n\nCambios en el contenido\nWhile BOW staff endeavor to preserve the integrity of contributors’ original work, editorial modifications may be necessary to ensure alignment with BOW’s established standards and guidelines. When a substantial revision is called for, editors will endeavor to provide comprehensive feedback detailing significant changes and necessary modifications. Contributors who do not adequately address these requirements may face additional editorial intervention, rejection of submitted materials, or removal of content. Should disagreements arise regarding content or editorial changes, BOW staff will engage in constructive dialogue with the concerned parties to reach a resolution. In instances in which consensus proves unattainable, BOW staff maintain ultimate editorial authority over platform content, though contributors retain the right to withdraw their submissions and discontinue their participation in the project.\nIn addition to changes made during the course of a draft’s editorial review, changes to BOW species accounts may be made by subject-matter experts. BOW editors strive to maintain consistency from account to account. As such, certain conventions must be followed, and certain language must be used, especially with regard to systematics/taxonomy, molts/plumages, and the structure/organization of vocal outputs. To ensure a standard treatment of such sections, BOW staff may assign expert contributors (including staff members) to revise specific sections or assist in their revision. Authorship for these contributions follows the standard policies, unless by mutual agreement.\nContributors have three options regarding specialized content: \n\nContributors may request (or leave to an editor’s discretion) that a BOW subject-matter expert prepares the specialized content, which contributors can then review and edit, if necessary, prior to publication. This is the most common approach. BOW staff will arbitrate any content disputes.\nContributors may opt to prepare the material themselves after informing BOW staff of their intent, typically via the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish). Expert contributors will review this content, ensure compliance with BOW conventions, and suggest necessary changes. BOW staff will mediate any content disagreements. \nContributors may collaborate with a subject-matter expert during content preparation. The details of such collaborative efforts must be worked out early in the revision process.\n\nOn occasion, there may be an immediate need to revise certain parts of an account within a strict time frame (e.g., during BOW’s annual taxonomic update or if a species’ conservation status changes). These changes may result in a version change. Typically, BOW staff will make the required changes themselves or ask a contributor to do so, but smaller changes, like common name changes, may happen automatically. While active contributors will be notified of any significant content changes that are needed or planned, they may not be informed of minor taxonomic alignments with the eBird/Clements Checklist, such as changes to subspecies or genus-level changes.\nSuitable contributors and/or subject-matter experts who are not involved in a revision a priori may be invited to review accounts before publication at the discretion of BOW staff. Contributors may request external review but cannot prevent it if deemed necessary by editors. Reviewers will be acknowledged in Revision Notes and will submit feedback via a Word document or email, making direct edits only with mutual agreement of BOW staff and the relevant contributors.",

    "text": "INTRODUCCIÓN\nIn general, when you cannot find information on a given topic, please fill in that section with “Information needed” or “Information is needed” (not with “No information,” “No data,” or “Nothing known”). Similarly, use statements like “Additional information needed” instead of “No other information.” If you did not search for literature for a section(s), you may note “This section was not evaluated.” For sections or subsections in which there might not ever be any relevant information for a species because the behavior does not apply (e.g., Nonbreeding Nests, Cooperative Breeding, or Brood Parasitism by Other Species), use “Not reported.”\nPlease avoid using the words “recent” or “recently” in accounts. These are relative terms, and some accounts are updated more frequently than others, which can lead to misleading statements in some cases. Please try to provide the relevant year (or range of years) whenever possible.\nAll accounts should include a concise introduction of 1–5 paragraphs. Introduce your species to the reader, emphasizing aspects that make it unique, including (as appropriate) systematics, appearance, distribution, migration, habitat, foraging, breeding, population size, and conservation. The best introductions are not simply a summary of factual details but strive for readability while still reflecting the science within the account. Descriptions of appearance should be concise and are generally not the focus of the Introduction. Descriptions of range should be general (e.g., “occurs in montane forests of Tanzania and Kenya, typically from 2,600–3,400 m”). Introductions generally do not include cited references unless a quote is included or information that is not cited elsewhere in the account is presented. Some accounts have summarized aspects of the species that are well studied, providing citations, especially at the end of the Introduction.",

    "text": "IDENTIFICACIÓN EN EL CAMPO\n\nIdentificación en el campo (introducción)\nIf the Identification article is particularly long, summarize the most important aspects of the identification of the species, including the essential field marks. A bulleted list may be appropriate here. Avoid citations in this section.\n\n\nIdentificación\nProvide a general summary description of the major points of identification for adults and juveniles by sex (when age and sex can be determined). The terms “adults” or “first-cycle birds” can be used here, but be sure to include the plumage(s) in parentheses following the terms, as listed under Plumages. “Juveniles” can be used for birds in Juvenile Plumage without the need for the extra term. Include separate descriptions for adults in Definitive Basic and Definitive Alternate Plumages if they differ (or state that they are similar if an alternate plumage occurs and is similar in appearance to basic plumage). After adults of each sex and plumage are described, briefly describe Juvenile, Formative (usually), and all other predefinitive plumages in about one sentence each. When appropriate, discussion of subspecies, notable morphs or color variants, or otherwise unique populations can be briefly included.\nThe diagnosis should be scientific rather than that of a field guide, but it should also be easy to read and digest by novices. Stress features of size, shape, color, or structure that can be recognized on birds in the field. Give the overall (general) length and mass of live birds, accompanied by a statement of relative size compared to related species if useful for identification (e.g., “a medium-sized hummingbird”). Report any differences in length, mass, or plumage between males and females. Keep this section succinct. Detailed descriptions of size, color, etc., will be called for in other sections. No subsections are needed for this section.\n\n\nResumen sobre especies similares\nIf the Similar Species section is of substantial length (5+ paragraphs), please use the Similar Species Summary to briefly summarize the key issues. Avoid too much repetition with Similar Species, however.\n\n\nEspecies similares\nSummarize the major points of identification that distinguish your species from any closely related or otherwise similar species. Cite any recent papers that thoroughly discuss how to distinguish your species from similar species in the field, but do not include references to standard field guides. Identification among subspecies (or morphs, variants, etc.) may also be briefly included here, although any detailed description of subspecies appearance should be included in the Subspecies section on the Systematics page. Keep this section succinct. Detailed descriptions of size, color, etc., will be called for in other sections. No subsections are needed for this section.",

    "section": "PLUMAJES, MUDAS Y ESTRUCTURA",
    "text": "PLUMAJES, MUDAS Y ESTRUCTURA\n\nPlumajes\nDetails of each plumage by age and season are described here. Base your description on a designated subspecies, usually the nominate subspecies, or the most widespread subspecies if there is not sufficient information for the nominate. Variation among subspecies should be confined to the Geographic Variation section on the Systematics page. Indicate if the plumage descriptions apply to all populations (e.g., for monotypic species or those in which subspecies do not vary much in plumage appearances). Include a discussion of different morphs if relevant. Include the following sentence in all accounts: “See Molts for molt and plumage terminology.”\nBegin each section with any fundamental information on structure, including the number of primaries, secondaries, and rectrices in the species; flight-feather numbering; whether the bird is diastataxic; and any special ways in which a standard bird morphology is modified in this species (e.g., “wings are rounded, with p6 the longest primary”). Refer to other revised BOW accounts for feather numbering and how to describe it. Include a sentence on whether sexes differ (within each plumage if appropriate) and in what plumage or plumages definitive appearance is attained.\nMolt and plumage terminology typically follows Humphrey and Parkes (1959), as modified by Howell et al. (2003). Describe each of the plumages that occur in the order in which they occur developmentally, i.e., from Natal Down to Definitive Basic (and Alternate, if any) Plumages. Subsections include Natal Down, Juvenile (First Basic) Plumage, Formative Plumage (present in many species), First Alternate Plumage (if present), Definitive Basic Plumage, and Definitive Alternate Plumage (if present). The heading “First and Definitive Alternate Plumages” can be used if they are similar to each other or to Formative and Definitive Basic Plumages; if this is used, indicate that aging criteria are listed under Formative and Definitive Basic Plumages. Subheadings that will be needed for some but not all species include Second Basic Plumage, Second Alternate Plumage, Third Basic Plumage, etc., up to Fourth or Fifth Basic Plumages for some gulls and eagles and up to Eight or Ninth Basic Plumages for some albatrosses and frigatebirds. Headings such as “Second and Definitive Basic Plumages” or “Fourth through Sixth Basic Plumages” can be used when some but not all birds can be identified or there is overlap in the plumage in which definitive appearance is reached. Please note that the term “First Basic Plumage” should generally be avoided in the text; “Juvenile Plumage” should be used instead. First Basic is used in headings only for clarity. See Molts (below) for other rarely used plumages, such as Supplemental and Auxiliary Formative Plumages. Headings include “Female” and “Male” (in this order) in bold if these plumages differ substantially in appearance. If they differ only subtly or on average, the difference can be summarized in a sentence, without the need for headings by sex.\nList references with detailed descriptions (if any) on which plumages and age determination are based. Generally, these can either be listed once at the beginning of the account or following detail under each plumage.\nTerms such as “nestling,” “fledgling,” “immature,” and “adult” plumage should be avoided. We recognize, however, that use of these descriptors may be appropriate in some situations, especially when there is delayed plumage maturation. Likewise, use of banding terms/abbreviations such as “hatch year/HY,” “after-hatch-year/AHY,” or “third-year” to refer to plumages should also be avoided. We no longer use the term “Juvenal”—please use “Juvenile” as both a noun and an adjective. \nThe most complete plumage descriptions should be those of Definitive Basic Plumage (male and female separately or just one description if sexes similar). Then compare other plumages to Definitive Basic Plumage. In some cases, just a few differences are all that need to be noted, whereas in other cases (often Juvenile Plumage for body feathers), fuller descriptions may be needed when appearance differs substantially from Definitive Basic Plumage. Differences in wing and tail feathers are often slight and often can be conveyed comparatively. Give representative dates, if possible, for each plumage in the text. Month ranges can be given to cover a plumage from fresh to worn, e.g., “Definitive Basic Plumage occurs primarily in September to August.”\nFor each plumage, describe the overall color and pattern of the feathering and then any significant details of color, pattern, or texture in individual feathers. Proceed in the following sequence: upperparts (including head, nape, back, rump, and tail); facial features (including lores, supercilium, eyeline, auriculars, and side of head); upperwings, generally in the order upperwing coverts (lesser, median, and greater as needed), tertials, secondaries, and primaries; and underparts (including chin, throat, breast, abdomen, ventral region, undertail coverts, and underwing coverts). Briefly describe head patterning, including subauricular and malar stripes if present. In some cases, a different order can be followed, e.g., if the sides of the head, the neck, and the throat are all one color. Follow the terminology in the Glossary (Appendix 6). Distinguish between regions and tracts if it is necessary to discuss feathers according to where they arise on the body. For the names of feather tracts, in passerines and nonpasserines with similar pterylosis follow Clench (1970); in other nonpasserines follow Lucas and Stettenheim (1972). \nTry to use simple and widely used color terms, such as “grayish brown” (include a hyphen if used before the noun it modifies, e.g., “grayish-brown upperparts” but “upperparts are grayish brown”). When possible, use color terms in a comparative sense to describe differences between plumages.\nThe Macaulay Library can be extensively used to describe plumages, especially when no other descriptions exist (e.g., for many non–North American species). Filters can be set for “Juvenile,” “Immature,” and months of the year to describe basic and alternate plumages, and to “flying” to search for images of the open upperwing and underwing coverts and flight feathers. Generally, it is best to order images by “Best Quality” to find the best images to base descriptions upon.\n\n\nMudas\nYou should briefly summarize any relevant variation in molt strategies within the species. Begin each section with a paragraph describing the molt strategy and terminology used. Include the sentence: “Molt and plumage terminology follows Humphrey and Parkes (reference link), as modified by Howell et al. (reference link)”; see example accounts for references. Then indicate what molt strategy is followed with a sentence such as “XXX exhibits a Complex Alternate Strategy (cf. reference links), including complete prebasic molts, a partial to incomplete Preformative Molt, and absent to limited prealternate molts in both age groups (links to specific citations on molt and to the molt chart diagram).” Again, see examples for different wording. Indicate here if there is any geographic variation in molt strategies. Generally, strategies will not differ, but timing and extent of molts may differ, especially for species with wide latitudinal occurrence (e.g., north temperate, tropical, and south temperate populations). Indicate is there is any sex-specific variation in molts; this is rare but occurs in some species, such as waterfowl with alternate plumages.\nSubsections follow those presented in Plumages and include (in the same developmental order) Prejuvenile (First Prebasic) Molt, Preformative Molt (present in many species), First and Definitive Prealternate Molts (if present), and Definitive Prebasic Molt. Other headings following this format can be used for species with delayed plumage maturation or more complex strategies, as described under Plumages. Generally, First and Definitive Prealternate Molts are similar within a species and should be combined here, more so than in Plumages, which can differ between ages. A few species have three molts and plumages within a cycle and will need headings for First and/or Definitive Presupplemental Molts or Auxiliary Preformative Molt (which was formerly referred to as a first presupplemental molt). In some cases, separate headings under Plumages will be needed to describe appearance following these molts. The plumages/molts editor can help decide how to present such molts and plumages in BOW accounts. Often, it is unclear if certain molts occur in a species or not, and this uncertainty can be expressed in the top paragraph under molts.\nUnder each heading, describe the extent of the molt as one or more of the following: “absent” if no feathers can be replaced in some individuals; “limited”  if some but not all body feathers are replaced; “partial” if most or all body feathers, some to all upperwing coverts, and often 1–3 tertials and/or 1–2 central rectrices are replaced; “incomplete” if some but not all primaries, secondaries other than tertials, and/or rectrices other than the central pair are replaced; or “complete” if all feathers are replaced. More than one category often is needed to describe molts, e.g., prealternate molts that are “absent to limited,” Preformative Molts that are “partial to incomplete,” or prebasic molts that are “incomplete to complete” (e.g., for species with Staffelmauser patterns). Then, indicate timing (if known) and give detail on variation in extent, including how many wing coverts or flight feathers can be replaced (again, if known). For species outside North American or Europe, reference to Macaulay Library images can often help ascertain this when molt extents are not described in the literature. Under Definitive Prebasic Molt, describe the sequence in which flight feathers are replaced, often something like “Primaries are replaced distally from p1 to p10, secondaries bilaterally from the second tertial and proximally from s1, and rectrices generally distally on each side of the tail, although exceptions can occur.” These sequences tend to be very fixed within families of birds and can be assumed to follow for species in which they are unknown. Do not use the terms “descendant,” “ascendant,” “centrifugal,” or “centripetal” to describe molt sequences. Summarize the timing and extent of the molts on the annual cycle diagram (let BOW staff know if you would like to make changes to this figure).\n\n\nPartes descubiertas\nDescribe the coloring, size, and shape of these parts from nestling to adult, relating the changes to age. Generally, it is best to describe age in terms of months as opposed to plumages since plumage change is independent of bare-part color change. Describe the progressive or seasonal development of structures such as the eye combs of certain grouse and the bill plates of procellariiforms and puffins. Give the colors of live or freshly dead birds, either from direct observation or notes on specimen labels. Do not necessarily trust museum skins or color photographs for subtleties of color.\n\n\nMedidas\nUse metric units wherever possible, and convert any values that do not use metric units. Follow instructions on statistics (see Appendix 4). In limited situations, imperial units may be included along with metric units when it would be useful. For both linear measurements and masses, list measurements of females before those of males. Variation by age, subspecies, or geographic region may also be presented. Discuss clinal variation if possible or refer to a paper in which the subject is treated.\nIf taking measurements yourself, be sure to do so according to the standardized guidance below so that they are repeatable. Classify your data by sex, age, population/subspecies, or geographic range when possible. Provide the mean, SD or SE, and range when possible. Avoid using measurements from field guides because they are likely to be secondary or inaccurate. If the normal method of measuring your species differs from the diagnoses below, follow the method normally used, but specify what it is. If a source does not specify how a measurement was taken, indicate that the method used was “unspecified.”\nLinear Measurements\nGroup measurements (in mm) under the following headings. In most cases, you should use bolded, inline headings like those used below (for an example, see Cassin’s Kingbird). However, if multiple paragraphs are needed under each heading, use the Heading 2 text style (for an example, see Rufous-banded Miner).\nTotal Length. From the bill tip to the tail tip. Usually measured from a museum specimen.\nWing Length. From the carpal joint to the tip of the longest primary on a wing folded in its natural position. From a museum specimen or live bird. Specify whether the unflattened wing length or flattened wing length is given.\nTail Length. From the point between the central pair of rectrices where they emerge from the skin to the tip of the longest rectrix.\nBill Length. Several bill measurements are commonly used, so please specify which measurement is being reported (or indicate that this is unspecified in the original source). If taking measurements yourself, exposed culmen (the chord from the edge of the forehead feathers to the tip of the mandible) is preferred by BOW. Other common bill measurements include the chord from the anterior edge of the nostril, from the naso-frontal hinge of the skull, or from the edge of the cere to the tip of the mandible.\nTarsus Length. A diagonal from the middle of the ankle joint (behind) to the middle of the joint between the tarsus and the middle toe (in front).\nReport (or give references for) other external or internal measurements that may be available, especially those of potential use for identification of species, age, or sex, e.g., wingspan, wing width, tip of folded wing to tip of tail, tip of folded wing to tip of undertail coverts, or tip of folded wing to tips of secondary remiges. Insert such additional measurements in a logical order among the headings above (e.g, place “Head Length” before “Bill Length”).\nMass\nGive the total mass (in g), classified when possible by sex, age, time of year, breeding, migration, population, subspecies, etc. Report the locality plus basic statistics (mean, SD or SE, and range). Give references to published masses of internal organs when available.",

    "section": "SISTEMÁTICA",
    "text": "SISTEMÁTICA\n\nHistoria de la sistemática\nThis section should aim to encompass the taxonomic history of the species, focusing principally on publications since the relevant volume of the Peters Checklist, including any relevant discussions of scientific name synonymies or debate on scientific name validity. This also is the section in which to discuss any data that might conflict with the current taxonomy of the species or of the genus, e.g., to highlight genetic or other research that may, in the future, lead to different arrangements. Mention, where relevant, taxonomic discrepancies at the species level between the four main world lists (differences in subspecific approach should be included under Subspecies, below). If the species has recently been split or lumped, this is also the section in which to briefly discuss what taxon/taxa it was split from, or what taxon/taxa it was lumped with, as well as any relevant data that led to the change.\nFor monotypic species, this section is the place to record the original combination (i.e., original genus and species name when the taxon was first described), author, and year of publication, place (book/journal, including volume and page numbers) of publication, type locality, and information concerning type specimen(s) (collector, date of collection, museum, and reference to type catalogue). (For polytypic species, this information will go into the Subspecies section.) In cases in which the original description is available online at a potentially stable URL (e.g., Biodiversity Heritage Library), it is useful to link to this. Many museum type catalogs are available at Biodiversity Heritage Library, but not all, and some large institutions still lack such works, or they are only partly complete. For sample formats, see below. Where possible/appropriate, please also present the same information for any well-recognized synonyms. It is also useful to link to the Wikipedia page (or another reasonably permanent source) for the collector. Include the person’s years of life if known.\nPeters (https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/14581) serves as a good starting point for such data. The Richmond Index (https://zoonomen.net/cit/RI/SP/RIspTotal.html) can also be useful for identifying bibliographic details and sometimes whereabouts of type material.\nMention proposed alternative generic arrangements for your species, but focus on recent modifications promoted by molecular sequencing data, rather than attempting to provide a complete generic history. Some overlap with content in Related Species may be inevitable as a result. Generic histories are often available via key catalogs such as Peters, Sharpe’s Catalogue of the Birds of the British Museum, and, for the Western Hemisphere alone, Cory and Hellmayr, Ridgway, etc., so you may wish to provide links to one or more of these works.\nNote: If you would like to include information on scientific names that is not provided in The Key to Scientific Names (available by clicking the “i” icon next to the species’ name at the top of the page), please add it to the Systematics History section.\nExamples of how to cite names and type data:\n(1) Straightforward case (i)\nDicaeum formosum Ogilvie-Grant, 1912, Bulletin of the British Ornithologists’ Club 29:109.—Mt. Arizan, 7,000 ft, Taiwan.\nThe holotype, an adult male collected by Walter Goodfellow in March 1912, is held at the Natural History Museum, Tring (NHMUK 1913.1.29.55) (20).\n(2) Straightforward case (ii) (how to add information not contained in the original description—enclose it within square brackets; in this example, to clarify the whereabouts of the type locality)\nDicaeum ignipectus dolichorhynchum Deignan, 1938, Proceedings of the Biology Society of Washington 51:97.—summit of Khao Nom Plu [07°35′ N, 99°50′ E], 3,000 ft., Trang Province, peninsular Thailand.\nThe holotype, an adult male collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott on 26 February 1897, is held at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. (USNM 160382) (32).\n(3) Potential doubts over type material/dating\n(a) Dryobates subcirris Stejneger, 1886, Proceedings of the United States National Museum 9:113.—Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.\nThe holotype, an adult male collected by Thomas Wright Blakiston (1832–1891) in November 1881, is held at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. (USNM 96000) (54, 38). Kuroda (30) referred to another specimen (female, USNM 96001) in the same museum, also collected by Blakiston at Sapporo, on 12 October 1882, as a paratype, and both the latter and another female (considered juvenile by Stejneger but currently cataloged as an adult), collected by Pierre L. Jouy at Chinsenji Lake, on 31 August 1882, are indeed specifically referenced in the original description and thus validly considered to have such status.\n(b) Dryobates namiyei Stejneger, 1886, Proceedings of the United States National Museum 9:116, Plate 2.—Yamato [= Nara Prefecture], southwest of Osaka, Honshu, Japan [34.57° N, 135.77° E].\nThe holotype, an adult male collected by Henry James Stovin Pryer (1850‒1888) in September 1876, is held at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. (USNM 370446) (54, 65, 38). The type was originally at a museum in Tokyo (where Motoyoshi Namiye, 1854–1918, was employed as a zoologist) but was apparently retained in Washington by happenstance (54). C. W. Richmond believed that the plate depicting the new taxon was published as early as 8 July 1885, which given that the scientific name was made available on the depiction would mean that namiyei should be dated from one year earlier, if this could be confirmed.\nSynonyms:\nDryobates leucotis [sic] intermedius Kuroda Sr., 1921, Auk 38:580.—Dorogawa, Yamato province [= Nara Prefecture, 36.33° N, 138.57° E], Honshu. The holotype was an adult female collected by N. Teraoka on 4 January 1913 but was almost certainly lost during World War II, and of 16 paratypes, 10 of them from Matsudaira’s collection, 9 were from Yamashiro province [Kyoto Prefecture], but no details were given that would permit their retrospective identification (65, 38). Somewhat intermediate between the subspecies subcirris and namiyei. (Name originally preoccupied by Dryobates villosus intermedius Nelson, 1900.)\nDryobates leucotos kurodae Götz, 1925, Jahreshefte des Vereins für vaterländische Naturkunde in Württemberg 81:95. (New name for D. I. intermedius Kuroda, preoccupied; see previous entry.)\nDryobates leucotos uchidai Momiyama, 1927, Annotationes Ornithologiae Orientalis 1:3 (nomen nudum), 62 (Japanese text), 96 (English text).—Nisimera-mura, Koyu-gun, Hiuga province [= Miyazaki Prefecture, 32.25° N, 131.48° E], Kyushu. The holotype is an adult male collected by Tomogorô Tanaka in mid-March 1927 (not 1917 as stated in the original description) and held at the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology, Abiko (YIO 00117) (65, 38).\nDryobates leucotos tookaidonis Momiyama, 1927, Annotationes Ornithologiae Orientalis 1:66. (New name for northern form in Kuroda’s D. I. intermedius, and type details are the same as for the latter; see above.)\n(4) Missing/lost type material\n(a) Myzanthe ignipectus Blyth (ex Hodgson MS), 1843, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal 12:983.—Nepal and Bhutan.\nBlyth evidently had at least two males and a female available to him, and one of these syntypes, a male collected by Brian Houghton Hodgson (1800/01–1894) in Nepal in 1842, is in the collection of the Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata (ZSI 35576) (17; Gopinathan Maheswaran in litt. to G. M. Kirwan, April 2022); the whereabouts of the other two specimens, if they still exist, are unknown, but they are not at the Natural History Museum, Tring (18).\nSynonyms:\nDicaeum ignipectus pulchellum Koelz, 1954, Contributions from the Institute for Regional Exploration 1:21.—Sangau, Lushai Hills, Assam, India. The holotype is a female collected on 24 February 1953 by Walter Norman Koelz and held at the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S. (UMMZ 147881) (19). Described apparently on account of males being darker, although Salomonsen (11) failed to distinguish differences.\nDicaeum cyanonotum Styan, 1893, Ibis (6)5:470.—Ichang, upper Yangtse Valley, Hubei, China. Styan mentioned having three specimens in front of him (two males and a female), and Salomonsen (11) reported having examined them at the Natural History Museum, Tring, UK (NHMUK), but they are not listed in the relevant type catalog (20); however, a search by H. van Grouw (in litt. to G. M. Kirwan, February 2022) revealed the presence of NHMUK 1914.8.15.56, a male (which Styan evidently considered to be “the type”) and the female, NHMUK 1914.8.15.58, both collected in June 1890. (The whereabouts of Styan’s material is not always clear, but most seems to be held at either NHMUK [21, 22] or at the American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY, U.S. [23]). Described on the basis of having the sheen on the upperparts of the male more blue, less green, with greenish lesser coverts and rump, and a more orange color on the breast, Salomonsen (11) considered these purported differences to be reflective of individual, not geographical, variation, having examined specimens with some or all of these features from as far apart as western Sichuan and southern Vietnam.\n(b) Anas Fabalis Latham, 1787, General Synopsis of Birds, Supplement, p. 297.—Great Britain.\nLatham’s original specimens are very rare in collections (31), and the original specimen of this species is not known to be extant. Some sources have considered that Latham’s name matched the Pink-footed Goose (Anser brachyrhynchus) better than a bean goose (e.g., 32, 33), but as noted by Bourne (34) the ambiguous original description of this bird in Pennant is accompanied by an unambiguous figure depicting a Taiga Bean Goose.\n\n\nVariación geográfica\nBriefly summarize trends in size, color, vocalizations, or any other traits that are important within your species. Keep this section succinct, but this is probably the best place to discuss any geographic component to polymorphism. Detailed descriptions of size, color, etc., will be called for in other sections. In addition to variation in physical traits, discussion of intraspecific genetic variation, especially variation not strictly related to divergence among subspecies, is appropriate for this section. Examples include discussion of studies of gene flow among different populations across the range of a species, genetic structure not linked to known subspecies breaks (e.g., important biogeographic barriers that could suggest cryptic diversity), and metapopulations. In summarizing trends in physical and genetic characteristics, mention especially any notable clinal trends across a species’ range. Also note trends in geographic variation that do not map onto recognized subspecies, or cases in which trends in one trait run counter to those in other traits. In cases in which there is extensive material to discuss, it may be helpful to subdivide it via the subsections “Phenotypic Variation” and “Genetic Variation.”\n\n\nSubespecies\nList the subspecies currently recognized. Include the same information (original combination, authority, type specimens, etc.) as listed for monotypic species (see above) in the Systematics History subsection for each subspecies. Also, include the same details for synonyms, where appropriate. Describe ranges and general distinguishing characteristics. The Identification Summary subsection should focus either on differences from the nominate subspecies or from geographically proximate taxa, but in some cases, a mix of these approaches, or even a different one entirely, might prove appropriate. In any case, the aim is to succinctly elucidate those characters that make the taxon unique. In some cases, it may prove necessary to check original descriptions for information, but keep in mind that older descriptions (especially from the 1800s and early 1900s) were often based on very few specimens (including of comparison taxa), and authors were more inclined to recognize relatively trivial variation, which could make the characters used in such cases worthy of caveat. Note discrepancies and offer opinions on subspecies validity, if alternative treatments may be more appropriate. In such cases, please also inform Pamela Rasmussen (pcr44@cornell.edu) of your findings so that the eBird/Clements Checklist team can consider revising our treatment.\n\n\nEspecies emparentadas\nFocus on studies based on genetic data, given that most widely recognized species have been sampled, and only the most closely related species to your focal species. Comment briefly on how robust inferred relationships are (e.g., number of samples or loci screened) and any uncertainty in the analyses about those inferred relationships. In some cases, it may be interesting to contrast, briefly, current knowledge based on genetics with morphology-based classifications, where these differ especially dramatically or where the genetic data may not be particularly robust. Generally, though, the focus should be on recent studies that incorporate genetic data when available. In general, it is not necessary to provide a wider discussion of family-level or even genus-level relationships, especially for comparatively large (more speciose) groupings. However, for monospecific genera or families, a brief exposition of closest known relatives in other genera or families may be relevant, but keep in mind that our family-level texts already serve this purpose. In a few cases, it may be necessary to discuss relationships without the benefit of molecular data (e.g., “12 species of Accipiter remain unscreened genetically”). Even in cases in which a particular species has not been sampled genetically, it may be presumed to be very closely related to a species that has been sampled; in this case, it is appropriate to mention the genetic relationships of the species that have been sampled and to indicate that it is presumed that the present species is part of this group as well.\n\n\nHibridación\nDiscuss the extent of any hybridization with other species, if known. If hybridization with other species is frequent, or if the species forms a hybrid zone with another species, cite any relevant studies that discuss this hybridization, as well as relevant field marks that identify hybrids.\n\n\nFósiles\nWhile this section may be blank or brief for some species, it should be included wherever possible to show that most birds do have an important fossil history. In many instances, there is no fossil history for a particular species, but there may be fossil data for closely related extinct taxa that may represent an extinct ancestor of the present species, or even taxa whose identities are ambiguous due to incomplete material; this is also fine to include in this section. Please be clear whether you are referring to a fossil of the present species or a species like the present species. When describing the fossil, please include where the fossil was discovered, and from what time period it was from (including both the name of the period and approximate date range).",

    "text": "DISTRIBUCIÓN\nDo not simply refer the reader to your distribution map but outline the current geographic distribution of your species in terms of state, provincial, and country boundaries. Discuss any significant details that are not readily apparent on the distribution map, particularly regarding the breeding range (e.g., “within the breeding range, the species occurs only at elevations above…”). Please refer to Appendix 4 for guidance on the capitalization of geographic regions.\n\nDistribución (introducción)\nUse the Breeding Range and Nonbreeding Range subsections if relevant to your species. If not, simply cover the relevant information without using a subsection or add different subsections that would be useful.\nFor all subsections, the following terminology on occurrence may be helpful. Be sure to give the relevant range of months if discussing seasons (i.e., spring, summer, fall, winter):\n\nResident. Year-round presence in an area, including breeding, although different populations may occur from season to season.\n(Summer) Breeder. Leaves the area during the nonbreeding season; some birds on a summering ground may actually be birds in passage, not yet on their own breeding grounds.\nSummer visitor. Visits area during spring and summer but breeds elsewhere.\nFall visitor. Visits in late summer, fall, or early winter; generally postbreeding wanderers.\nWinter visitor. Resides in the area during the nonbreeding season.\nMigrant. A bird of passage, staying briefly while en route between its summer and winter homes.\nAccidental. The species has been recorded once or twice (rarely more) within a designated area and, on the grounds of reasonable probability, is unlikely to occur there regularly.\nCasual. The species has been recorded a few times within a designated area, not enough to constitute regular occurrence but enough to suggest that subsequent records are not improbable.\n\nBreeding Range/Nonbreeding Range\nThese sections should provide the best approximation of the species’ distribution throughout its range and throughout the relevant season (i.e., breeding or nonbreeding). You may want to provide a list of detailed descriptions by county or state (or other relevant subdivision), or you may prefer to summarize this information. Either approach is appropriate. \nYour text will be accompanied by a (purple) map of the species’ overall range via eBird. If eBird data products are available (e.g., map showing abundance throughout the year), they will also be included. You may want to link out to eBird distributions for specific areas or specific time periods throughout the text.\nRefer to Breeding Bird Atlases or other standardized distributional projects whenever possible. These references contain excellent information on current breeding status as well as historic changes in distribution. When applicable, the Christmas Bird Count may be useful for nonbreeding ranges and abundance. If you wish to include a link to these atlases, please use hyperlinked text, as opposed to listing a URL in the text.\nElevational Range\nProvide the elevations (in m above sea level) at which the species can be found. Include geographic and/or seasonal variation in the elevational range if relevant.\nIntroduced Range\nDiscuss the history and distribution of species introductions where populations have become established.\nExtralimital Records\nReport genuine records (with references) of occurrence beyond the normal range. You are encouraged to link out to documentation via eBird or the Macaulay Library, when possible.\n\n\nCambios históricos en la distribución\nSummarize any significant range expansions or contractions and causal factors thereof.",

Avoid citations in this section.\nHabitat Keywords\nAs possible, list the habitat categories and subcategories used by the species, as defined by Campbell et al. (2021) in the book Habitats of the World or other books in that series (described under Categorías de hábitats below), from most to least important. List the category followed by a colon and any applicable subcategories. Please do not include any other text in this section. The use of such categories will inform a forthcoming BOW data product containing key information on all bird species that will be useful for large-scale analyses. For example:\nConifer forests: taiga (boreal forest), temperate conifer forest\nTemperate deciduous forests: temperate deciduous forest, temperate moist mixed forest\n\n\nHábitat general\nFor resident species, start with a general description of its habitat, and then cover more specific details as needed. You may wish to use the habitat categories and subcategories defined by Campbell et al. (2021) in the book Habitats of the World (described under Categorías de hábitats below). If you have access to a copy of this book or any of its companion books for specific continents, the finer-scale habitat categories discussed might also be useful, but please note that consulting these books is by no means required. Characterize the habitat in terms of its latitudinal and elevational range and climatic limits, and describe the topography, substrate, and vegetation (including stages of growth and/or plant succession, dominant species and status, and spacing). Note, you may feel free to elaborate beyond the categories below.\nNote any habitat differences in different parts of the geographic range. Distinguish between habitats where the species occurs usually and those where it is uncommon. Do not use the phrases “habitat selection” or “habitat preference” unless there are direct studies of those specific phenomena. Compare habitats between your species and close relatives, particularly where they are sympatric.\nDetails of functional microhabitats, i.e., places used for particular activities, should be given on subsequent pages when discussing foraging, roosting, nesting, etc.\nLeave this section blank for migratory species (unless there are nonmigratory populations, which could be discussed here).\n\n\nHábitat en rango reproductivo\nFor migratory species, treat the habitat(s) as directed above under General Habitat, according to the species’ seasonal range. Leave this section blank for resident species.\n\n\nHábitat en migración\nFor migratory species, treat the habitat(s) as directed above under General Habitat, according to the species’ seasonal range. Leave this section blank for resident species.\n\n\nHábitat en rango no reproductivo\nFor migratory species, treat the habitat(s) as directed above under General Habitat, according to the species’ seasonal range.

    "text": "MOVIMIENTOS Y MIGRACIÓN\n\nMovimientos y migraciones (introducción)\nA brief, general statement of the species’ annual movements (or lack thereof) and any points of special note.\n\n\nDispersión y fidelidad al sitio\nReport any data available on the tendency of a bird to be either site faithful or dispersive. Subsections are self-explanatory (see Appendix 2). Any discussion of territory size or home range size should be included in the Population Spatial Metrics section.\n\n\nMovimientos no migratorios\nDiscuss any movements made by the species that do not qualify as migration or dispersal away from the breeding grounds (e.g., nomadic movements or daily movements for foraging and roosting).  Subheadings with special relevance to your species (e.g., “Movements to and from a Communal Roost”) can be included.\n\n\nVisión general de la migración\nCharacterize the seasonal movements of individuals between geographic areas and habitats. Provide an overview of differential migratory behavior of age and sex classes in time and space (you should provide details in Timing and Routes of Migration, below). Note any variation among populations of your species.\n\n\nCalendario y rutas de migración\nDescribe the timing and routes of migration on a broad geographic scale but point out known differences among populations. Give references to regional works for details and representative dates.\n\n\nConducta migratoria\nThe preceding section dealt with the “where” and “when” of migration; this section and the next concern the “how” of migration. These sections will vary widely among accounts, reflecting differences in knowledge of species’ migratory behavior. Include information and references on such topics as the usual time of day, altitude, and speed of migration; method(s) of orientation; responses to weather; and degree of flocking and flight formations. If any of these topics have been studied intensively in your species, summarize the major findings and provide references to the literature.\n\n\nControl y fisiología de la migración\nTopics to be discussed if they have been studied in your species include migratory restlessness, hyperphagia and fat deposition, response to photoperiod, and roles of hormones. Mention known variation among populations, sex, or age classes, but refer to the literature for details. Include any information indicating that migratory behavior is learned, e.g., from parents, or largely innate.",

    "section": "DIETA Y ALIMENTACIÓN",
    "text": "DIETA Y ALIMENTACIÓN\nUsually treat a species as a whole, but point out known variation according to sex, age, season, or locality. For migratory species, make a special effort to provide information on food habits in the nonbreeding range as well as the better-known habits in the breeding range. If populations/subspecies are widely separated or occupy markedly different environments, it may be best to treat them separately. Focus this section on the food habits of adults, leaving those of young birds (including items delivered to young birds by adults) for the relevant sections in Breeding.\n\nDieta y alimentación (introducción)\nA general summation of the species’ biology relating to feeding and brief mention of any points of special note. Avoid citations in this section.\n\n\nAlimentación\nMicrohabitat for Foraging\nThis subsection covers where foraging occurs, including substrates that food is obtained from (e.g., specific plant species or plant types and position within the vegetation, foraging height, substrate type, wetland types, distance from shore, or depth of water).\nFood Capture and Consumption\nThis subsection covers how food is obtained and consumed. In addition to the behavior itself, report the following if known and appropriate: time of day for foraging, percentage of time devoted to each foraging tactic during feeding, any specific anatomical or physiological adaptations for feeding, feeding-related interactions (e.g., cooperative hunting by pairs or flocks, commensalism, or piracy), and ability to exploit unusual opportunities for feeding.\n\n\nDieta\nMajor Food Items\nInclude a summary of general food types taken (add order, family, or scientific name, as appropriate). For example, “Diet mostly insects, especially grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera), ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), leafhoppers (Homoptera), bugs (Hemiptera), beetles (Coleoptera), as well as spiders (Araneae).” If information is taken from the literature, cite the names as originally published, and put any necessary corrections or revisions in square brackets. Give the size range (length or mass) of the items.\nQuantitative Analysis\nSummarize detailed quantitative studies to show the proportions of different kinds of food in the diet. State the nature of the data analyzed (e.g., observations of feeding, contents of esophagus or gizzard, or pellets) and the sample size. Guard against bias caused by differential digestibility of food items or postmortem digestion and bacterial action. Identify the method(s) used for expressing the amounts of food items (e.g., percentage of either volume, frequency of occurrence, or mass [wet or dry] of total food eaten). Bearing in mind these variables of methodology, report published differences in dietary composition, but be cautious in comparing them.\n\n\nSelección y almacenamiento de alimentos\nBriefly report any information on the senses of taste and smell, recognition and choice of food items, or caching and retrieval. Cite references for details. You may put this material into the Food Capture and Consumption subsection (under Feeding) if that will make the writing easier.\n\n\nNutrición y energética\nThe nutritional needs of wild birds have been studied in only a few species, but this section is included as a reminder of a topic that deserves attention. Report, when possible, the daily food intake and the nutritional and caloric values of foods. Express the relative importance of different foods in terms of the metabolic energy they provide.\n\n\nMetabolismo y regulación de la temperatura\nSummarize literature relevant to metabolic rate and temperature regulation by sex, season, age, and population when possible.\n\n\nIngesta, egagrópilas y defecación\nInclude a description of any unusual aspects or quantitative studies of these habits.",

    "text": "SONIDOS Y CONDUCTA VOCAL\nUse bioacoustic terms as they are defined in the Glossary (Appendix 6) so as to avoid confusion and errors. Do not use terms such as “phone,” “phrase,” or “syllable” unless absolutely necessary, in which case define them. The simplest way to explain what you mean is to label features on a spectrogram.\n\nSonidos y conducta vocal (introducción)\nA general summation of the species’ biology relating to sounds and brief mention of any points of special note. Avoid citations in this section.\n\n\nVocalización\nVocal Development\nProvide measurements, sound spectrograms, and references to document age-related changes and vocal learning, if possible.\nVocal Array\nDescribe important vocalization types verbally (phonetic English rendering) and provide measurements (duration, rates of repetition, and cadence) and spectrograms if possible. If your species has a large vocal repertoire, do not present it all, but choose the most frequent and behaviorally significant sounds and cite references. \nThis section will vary considerably among species, reflecting differences in acoustic signals of birds and our knowledge of them. With respect to your particular species, keep this section brief if little is known but amplify it, including references, in relation to the information available.\nIf there are no distinctions between songs and calls in your species, mention any ambiguities in the use of “song” when discussing the vocalizations.\nGeographic Variation\nDescribe variation (or lack thereof) in vocalizations and/or in response to vocalizations by geographic area.\nPhenology\nIdentify seasons of the greatest and least amount of vocalizing, including any activity during migration and on the nonbreeding grounds. If possible, mention any variation in the pattern according to season (including range of months) or social context. If possible, mention any variation in the number of song types per individual according to age, individual, season, or geographic area.\nDaily Pattern of Vocalizing\nSummarize the pattern of vocalization from morning to night.\nPlaces of Vocalizing\nCharacterize the vocalization site(s) (e.g., on the ground, from an elevated perch, or in flight) and compare with sites used for feeding or nesting. Summarize the daily pattern of vocal activity.\nSex Differences\nDescribe any differences in the vocalizations of males and females of your species. In a list of songs and calls, consider classifying them by sex. Note the sex of the singers (if known) on any spectrograms you present.\nRepertoire and Delivery of Songs\nDiscuss the song repertoire size of individual birds. Discuss the pattern(s) in which the elements of the song are delivered. For example, does the bird deliver a series of different song types without repetition, or is the same song type repeated multiple times before the bird switches to a new song type?\nSocial Context and Presumed Functions of Vocalizations\nFor each song/call, give its social context (presence, status, and activity of other individuals of the same or opposite sex or another species) and its presumed functions, plus any other evidence for that function. A bird’s habitat, behavior, and social context often provide clues to the functions of its sound signals. Brief generalizations about these conditions are therefore desirable when they can reasonably be made. Much information of this kind can be found in the field notes accompanying sound recordings.\nAvoid functional interpretation and names (e.g., “courtship call”) for sounds without considering the quality of the evidence, and cite that evidence. In particular, do not assume without evidence that a given sound is involved in either mate attraction, territorial defense, or both. Point out any intriguing problems for research on the acoustic signals of your species.\n\n\nSonidos no vocales\nSounds produced by the bill, feet, wings, or tail should be treated in the same general way as vocalizations, as appropriate and as information exists.",

    "text": "CONDUCTA\nThis page is organized as a compromise between the traditional series of separate subsections and the comprehensive treatment that a behaviorist would prefer. It covers a bird’s manner of moving about, taking care of itself, and interacting with other individuals of the same or different species. Other aspects of behavior are treated in the pages on Migration, Diet and Foraging, Sounds, Breeding, and Demography and Populations. For all sections, aim to progress from action patterns to higher levels of behavioral patterns.\n\nConducta (introducción)\nA general summation of the species’ biology relating to behavior and brief mention of any points of special note. Avoid citations in this section.\n\n\nLocomoción\nDescribe the physical movements, including posture and frequent movements like tail bobbing. Mention any specific anatomical or physiological adaptations for locomotion, and give any measurements of performance (e.g., speed of travel, number of wingbeats per second, altitude of flight, or depth and duration of dive). Attempt to relate these actions to their context or controlling factors and presumed functions. Point out known forms of variation, whether age related, sexual, seasonal, or geographic.\n\n\nAuto-mantenimiento\nDescribe what is known in terms of how the species maintains its condition. See list of subsections in Appendix 2. Use the terminology as defined in the Glossary (Appendix 6). If the situation in your species does not fit any of these categories, describe it instead of relying on labels.\n\n\nConducta agonística\nDescribe a species’ antagonistic behaviors toward conspecifics in the context of physical interactions, communicative interactions, or territorial interactions. Text regarding territorial interactions should emphasize seasonal and spatial use of territory, as well as how territories are advertised (details of singing, drumming, etc., are covered in Sounds and Vocal Behavior). Contributors should include subsections describing behaviors in both the breeding and nonbreeding periods, when possible.\n\n\nConducta sexual\nFor all subsections listed in Appendix 2, use the terminology for mating systems as defined in the Glossary (Appendix 6). If the situation in your species does not fit any of these categories, describe it instead of relying on labels. Avoid the terms “polygamy”—because it is useless—and “promiscuous”—because it is ambiguous. Note whether the mating system is influenced by habitat in particular populations.\n\n\nComportamiento social e interespecífico\nReview all subsections listed in Appendix 2. Place your species on a continuum from solitary to highly gregarious, noting seasonal fluctuations, the approximate size of aggregations, and the activity of such groups or flocks.\n\n\nDepredación\nWrite this section from the standpoint of your species as prey, not predator. The latter subject will have been covered on the Diet and Foraging page.",

    "section": "REPRODUCCIÓN",
    "text": "REPRODUCCIÓN\nFor each subsection, describe first the typical condition, i.e., that shown by experienced breeders in the best-known population. Then, report any variation among individuals, in younger breeders, or in other populations. If, however, subspecies of your species differ in at least several major aspects of their breeding, it may be more sensible to treat them in separate, comprehensive sections.\n\nReproducción (introducción)\nA general summation of the species’ breeding biology and brief mention of any points of special note. Avoid citations in this section.\n\n\nFenología\nUse the suggested subsections only if sufficient information is available for each stage of the breeding cycle. This section should provide representative dates and other information, where possible, while the annual cycle diagram shows the seasonal pattern of breeding in relation to migration and molting. The timing of pair formation and nest building should be given in the text but generally omitted from the diagram because it cannot be recorded as precisely as that of subsequent breeding events. For some species, even the latter are so poorly known that it would be pointless to try to include them in the diagram.\nMention what is known about the factors that control the timing of breeding in your species. Indicate how weather conditions affect vegetation growth and the availability of food and nest sites. Guard against drawing correlations, however, from studies that span only a few years because the situation may be more complex than it seems at first.\n\n\nSitios de nidificación\nSubsections include Selection Process (only rarely known) and Site Characteristics. For the latter, define the setting used for nesting, including the dominant plant species present, their size (height or diameter and breast height), and spacing. Include details on the specific location of the nest itself (e.g., nest height, plant species for nest placement, and specific location), and indicate nest locations that are atypical.\n\n\nNidos\nBegin by describing the type and shape of the nest. Describe how the nest is constructed, including how long it takes, where nest material is gathered from, and who builds the nest. If a cavity-nesting species, describe both the size and shape of the entrance hole and/or tunnel and whether an additional nest is built in the cavity. When discussing materials used for nest construction, include different materials used for different parts of the nest, as well as sizes of materials if relevant/known. Dimensions may include (but are not necessarily limited to) outer and inner dimensions of a nest, height, and mass.\n\n\nHuevos\nDiscuss any adaptations of, or variation in, egg shape. If you include data on egg size/mass or clutches, report the extremes of normal variation as well as mode(s), if possible. Mention any known patterns of variation associated with the age of the female, the seasonal timing of the clutch, or the position of the egg in the clutch. Geographic or subspecific variation should be noted, as before. If you are able to give measurements of eggshell thickness, include, if possible, the years when the eggs were laid in case they were thinned by environmental pollutants. For clutch size, give mean, SD or SE, and range, remembering that clutch size will be discussed in greater detail under Demography and Populations.\n\n\nIncubación\nThe incubation period is usually measured as the time in days (or in hours, when possible) from the laying of the last egg until the hatching of the last egg in the clutch. Indicate if your data are measured differently. Give the normal range and note any pattern of variation.\n\n\nEclosión\nThis section covers the period just before to just after hatching of the eggs. Discuss any behaviors or vocalizations (of the chicks or parents) that occur prior to hatching, the process of breaking the shell and emerging from the egg, whether eggs tend to hatch synchronously or asynchronously (and over how long a period), and whether the parents provide any assistance with hatching or dispose of the eggshells.\n\n\nAves jóvenes\nThis section covers the history of young birds from hatching until juvenile flight feathers are fully grown (“fledging”; see Appendix 6), at which stage the birds are able to fly. Treatment will necessarily vary because species differ in three major respects: amount of downy feathering at hatching (psilopaedic/ptilopaedic), length of stay in nest (nidicolous/nidifugous), and ability to move about and find one’s food soon after hatching (altricial/precocial). The conditions along these axes agree approximately, but numerous exceptions exist among nonpasserines. Owing to these discrepancies, do not rely on terms; instead, describe the conditions in your species. For nidifugous chicks, add the subsection Departure from the Nest (listed under Fledgling Stage in Appendix 2) in this section directly after Condition at Hatching. In describing the appearance of young birds, use the same terminology for plumages, body parts, and pterylosis as for older birds. Is the color pattern of the Natal Down or Juvenile Plumage cryptic?\n\n\nCuidado parental\nAdjust this section according to whether the young birds are nidicolous or nidifugous. Note any daily or seasonal variation as well as geographic variation in the activities.\n\n\nCría cooperativa\nIf the species breeds cooperatively (i.e., more than two individuals participate in parental care), address this behavior here. Describe the group members that help with offspring care, including their relatedness to the parents of the offspring being raised (e.g., previous offspring of one or both parents, other relatives of the parents, or nonkin), their ages, and the types of care they provide (e.g., nest building, incubation, or nestling feeding). Provide the frequency of cooperative breeding in various populations (e.g., percentage of pairs that have helpers) if known. Communal nesting (in which more than one pair reproduces using the same nest) should be considered a type of cooperative breeding.\n\n\nParasitismo de cría\nMany species of birds are subject to brood parasitism, and some are brood parasites themselves. If applicable, discuss the focal species’ parasitism of conspecifics and other species in the relevant subsections. The subsection Brood Parasitism by Other Species should discuss the species that parasitize the focal species (i.e., discuss situations in which the focal species is the host). What are the major parasites of this host, how does the host react to the parasite, and how is the host affected by brood parasitism? For the subsection Success of Parasite with this Host, try to give the percentage of parasitic young that leave the nest.\n\n\nEtapa de volantones\nThis section covers the period from acquisition of flight feathers and flying ability until independence from parents (and until the first breeding attempt if such information is available). Treatment will vary according to whether young birds of your species are nidifugous or nidicolous (e.g., the subsection Departure from the Nest should instead be reported under Young Birds, not here, for nidifugous species). Omit the following topics because they have been or will be included elsewhere: plumages and molts, food habits, vocalizations, and dispersal from the natal site. The final subsection, Behavior After Independence, covers the behavior of birds in that neglected yet critical period from the gaining of independence until the first attempt at breeding. Report, if possible, daily habits and time budget during this period. Descriptions of immature appearance should go in Plumages. Survivorship of these birds should be treated on the Demography and Populations page under Life Span and Survivorship.",

    "text": "DEMOGRAFÍA Y POBLACIONES\n\nDemografía y poblaciones (introducción)\nA general summation of demographic information about the species and brief mention of any points of special note. Avoid citations in this section.\n\n\nMedidas de la actividad reproductiva\nMany measures of reproductive success have been poorly defined in the literature. Therefore, if you report such data, you are urged to follow the terms in the Glossary (Appendix 6): hatching success, fledging success, nest success, and annual reproductive success. If you want to use other terms, particularly “breeding success” and “nesting success,” please define them. One measure of reproductive success that seems to be important, yet is seldom reported, is the probability that a female will rear one or more broods to independence or nest leaving during a breeding season. This value can be calculated by dividing the number of successful (as defined above) females in a population sample by the total number of breeding females in the sample. If you are able to calculate this value, provide, if possible, an estimate of variance.\n\n\nTiempo de vida y supervivencia\nEnsure that you report only sound measures of survivorship (e.g., mark–recapture or band recapture, resighting, or recovery). With rare exceptions (e.g., species like the Florida Scrub-Jay in which the precise fate of every individual of the population is known), survival estimates based on any methods that do not incorporate these statistical procedures are not valid because they do not differentiate sighting probabilities from mortality probabilities and do not consider annual variation in survival.\nAs a minimum, a contributor should indicate how survival rates were calculated, but it would be better to exclude invalid data; no data are always better than wrong data. Even with sound statistics, some estimates have their limitations. For example, mark–recapture data always confound emigration with mortality. Thus, it is always necessary to indicate how the rates were calculated.\n\n\nPatógenos y parásitos\nPathogens\nDescribe and discuss pathogens (i.e., disease-causing agents) known to affect the species. Include a discussion of both the pathogen itself and the disease associated with it. Provide data on the incidence of the infection if possible. Include pathogenic parasites under this subsection rather than the Parasites subsection. Also discuss vectors of disease if relevant.\nParasites\nDescribe and discuss internal and external parasites of the species, including their effects on the host, if known. Provide data on the incidence of parasites if possible.\n\n\nCausas de mortalidad\nDiscuss natural causes of mortality for adults and young, but do not repeat information covered in other sections—simply refer the reader to those sections.\n\n\nMétricas espaciales poblaciones\nThis section should discuss metrics of spacing, including individual distance, territory size, home range size, and population density. Individual distance can include nest spacing, distance between territories, distance between birds roosting or within foraging flocks, etc. See definitions in Appendix 6 for differences between territory and home range. Territorial behaviors should be included on the Behavior page under Agonistic Behavior. Density can include measures like the number of birds per hectare, number of birds per net-hour, etc.\n\n\nEstado de las poblaciones\nWith the exception of poorly known species that lack data on population size and trends, this section should include the subsections Numbers and Trends. For Numbers, provide the most recent published global population estimate (with confidence interval and years of estimate) in the first sentence, followed by estimates for countries, regions, or ecoregions with significant populations (ecological regions are preferred over smaller areas defined by political boundaries). For North American species, check the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory (Partners in Flight) population estimates. After that, add information on densities or relative abundance within habitats, remembering to indicate the measure of density used (e.g., number of singing males or number of individuals). Present data from breeding-period surveys before data from nonbreeding periods. Under the Trends subsection, provide published estimates of population change over time, including the trend estimate, time frame (years), and confidence interval (if available). Focus trend results on areas with larger populations and the most reliable data.\n\n\nRegulación poblacional\nDiscuss here the impact of physical factors, competition, or predation on populations, noting geographic variation when known.",

The economic aspects and drivers of hunting by humans, as well as hunting on a small enough scale that it does not impact populations, should be discussed under Economic and Utilitarian Significance on the Relationship with Humans page. “Collisions” includes birds striking lighthouses and other tall buildings, electrical wires, TV towers, and windows, as well as being hit by cars, planes, boats, etc. \nFor each appropriate subsection for which there is information, describe the locations and times of year and manner in which the mortality occurs, and the number of individuals killed, if known. If a subsection has been discussed in another section, refer the reader there and briefly summarize, but do not repeat, all of the information here.\n\n\nManejo\nMost of the subsections (see Appendix 2) in this section are self-explanatory. For Conservation Areas, list and discuss the protected areas used by the species. If there are too many areas to list them all, focus on the largest, most important, or otherwise most relevant areas.

Avibase is an excellent starting place to look for such names. Also mention other regularly/widely used common names for either the same taxonomic arrangement or other widely recognized arrangements, e.g., in regional field guides and other major checklists. One of the main aims should be to eliminate confusion in the minds of readers that is promoted by using different vernacular names.\nNote: It is not necessary to provide information concerning the etymology of the scientific names, as information from James Jobling’s Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names is available by clicking the “i” icon next to the species’ name at the top of the page. If you would like to include information on scientific names that is not provided by Jobling, please add it to the Historia de la sistemática section.\nNote that a generic list of common names in other languages is provided in the account as a pop-up on the Introduction page (under “Names” next to the species’ conservation status); however, it is not comprehensive, nor is it necessarily representative of all the relevant names and languages within the species’ range. This list is maintained by eBird, and any proposed additions or changes should be referred to that project.\n\n\nSignificado cultural, simbólico y estético\nEarly History\nDescribe how the species has been recorded in human history, including archaeological evidence of the species interacting with humans before recorded history.\nPresence in Folklore, Religion, and Symbolism\nDiscuss appearances of the species in different cultures’ religions and folklore and any symbolic uses of the species (such as designation as a national bird or use on a flag).\nDepictions in Media\nMention depictions of the species in media, art, literature, stamps, etc., and the social impact of those depictions.\nPublic Perception\nDiscuss the general public perception of the species by the communities in which it occurs.\n\n\nSignificado económico y utilitario\nUse by Humans\nExamples of use by humans, including both those that generally have a negative impact on the focal species (e.g., harvest, egging, or the feather trade) and those that may have a mixed or more positive impact (e.g., tourism, bird feeders, or webcams). Focus on brief descriptions on the nature of and history of use, including relevant regulations, economic value of that use, and the social context and perception of that use. Discuss the relative positive or negative impacts of that use on the focal species. Substantial population-level impacts of use can be discussed here but, if negative, are better discussed on the Conservation and Management page under Effects of Human Activity.\nHarm Inflicted by Focal Species\nDiscuss any negative social, environmental, or economic impacts caused by the focal species, e.g., as a crop pest, through collisions with aircraft, or as an invasive species. Discuss preventive measures taken against such effects and their ecological and economic impacts.\nAviculture and Domestication\nDiscuss the presence of this species in aviculture, including its history, the numbers kept, the regions where it is kept, source populations, and whether captive breeding is established. If domesticated, give a brief overview of the source and timing of domestication and the uses of domestic birds.

    "text": "Referencia a las especies\n\nAny bird species mentioned in an account should be included using the Species Name button (or “species tag”).\n\nThe default species is the species whose account you are editing. To include the name of any other species, type the name into the search bar.\n\nAdd both common and scientific names (and check the “HTML Link to Account” button) at the first mention of a bird species per section (select “Both” from the “Display Name As” dropdown in the Species Name window) when referring to species other than the focal species of the account. For subsequent mentions of such a nonfocal species in the same section, neither the scientific name nor a link to the account is needed. For short pages, you may use the scientific name and link to the account only the first time the species is named on the page. When referring to the focal species, the scientific name is not typically used except in certain discussions on the Systematics page in which it is helpful to use it.\n\nThe Species Name button tags a name such that the common name can be changed based on a user’s settings and a name can be automatically updated in case of changes in taxonomy or nomenclature. If there are cases in which you want to use a name and you do not want it to ever change (with either language or taxonomy), do not use the species tag. This may be useful if discussing the history of a name or taxon or mentioning local names of species.\n\nThe Species Name button does not include subspecies, standalone genera (i.e., without a species name), or families and should not be used in those situations.\n\nA genus, or a species name plus a subspecies, should be italicized using the “Sci Name” tag (and linked to the corresponding URL if a genus; see Paso 3: Comprender la barra de menús del editor). For example, “Zosterops,” “Zosterops c. conspicillatus.”\n\nBird species should be referred to in the singular, e.g., “The Red-tailed Hawk occurs in a wide variety of habitats.”\n\nThe species tag is singular for common names, and we encourage structuring your sentences this way. Please do not use an s or ’s as plain text directly after the gray species tag, as this will not translate properly. To refer to the plural of a species, we recommend simply using the singular species tag if the sentence cannot be restructured (e.g., “Three Red-tailed Hawk were observed”).\n\nWhen discussing species, try to use the singular (e.g., “the male,” or “it eats”) instead of the plural (e.g., “males,” or “they eat”) whenever possible.\nPlease avoid the use of general terms like “hummingbirds” or “rails” to refer to the focal species. Always use the species tag for the focal species when possible. If you are referring to a general group of birds, please use the genus or family name whenever possible and link to the appropriate genus or family page on BOW (see Paso 3: Comprender la barra de menús del editor). This will help to avoid ambiguity when translating species accounts.\nEnsure that the focal species is mentioned (using its common name and the species tag) at the beginning of each page. Avoid beginning a page with “It,” as it should first be made clear that “it” refers to the focal species.\nUse quotation marks around old bird names no longer recognized by the eBird/Clements Checklist, including old taxonomic concepts even if the current name still exists.\nWhen referring to a vernacular name for a species in a language other than English, use the capitalization conventions consistent with the language of origin. Enclose the name in double quotation marks, ensuring that periods and commas go inside the quotation marks.\nIn tables, references, and media/figure captions, where species tags are not supported, please ensure that bird common names are capitalized and punctuated according to the eBird/Clements Checklist (http://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/).\nDo not capitalize names of mammals, plants, insects, or species in any other taxon, unless they include a proper noun.\n\nWe generally follow the criteria used by iNaturalist as a standard for nonbird scientific names. You can search their species database (https://www.inaturalist.org/observations) and see their Curator Guide (https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/curator+guide#authorities) for details on the taxonomic authorities that they use.\nFor species not available in iNaturalist, it may be helpful to consult the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (https://www.gbif.org/) or, for marine species, the World Register of Marine Species (https://www.marinespecies.org/).\nIf a species’ scientific name has changed since the publication of a source that you are citing, please indicate the new name in square brackets to allow the reader to understand the relevant species when referring to both the cited literature and current literature. For example, water hyacinth (Eichhornia [Pontederia] crassipes).",

Retain glottal stops in Hawaiian terms, although note that no glottal stop is used in the state name (Hawaii), but one is used in the island name (Hawai’i). Non-Latin scripts may not have direct English equivalents; consult an accepted transliteration system or regional authority when necessary.\nFor locations with multiple names, prioritize the name used in the local language when possible and give the English name in parentheses afterward.\nSpell out names of states and provinces, counties, and countries (e.g., North Dakota, British Columbia, Maricopa County). However, “U.S.” should generally be used for the United States (although note exception in references) and “UK” may be used for the United Kingdom, but this is not required.\nUse “Washington, D.C.” (although note exception in references).\nThe first time a location is mentioned in a given section of the account, specify the place, state/province/department/region, country (e.g., “Ithaca, New York, U.S.). For subsequent mentions of the location in the same section, you can simply use the place (e.g., “Ithaca”). If the page is short, you may instead provide this information only the first time the location is used on the page.\nIn contrast to what was done in the original, printed accounts, when referring to specific areas within states, provinces, countries, etc., spell out directional references such as “northern” or “northeastern,” e.g., “northern Wyoming,” “northeastern Mexico,” or “southwestern Ontario.” Also, use “south-central,” “north-central,” etc. Note that these terms are not capitalized except when referring to a few specific formal regions with well-known English names.\nFollow the list below, which typically follows The Chicago Manual of Style (18th edition):\n\nCentral America\ncentral Asia\ncentral Europe\nthe East (in the U.S.)\nEast Africa\nthe East Coast (in the U.S.)\nthe Eastern Hemisphere\neastern Europe\nthe equator\nequatorial\nFalkland Islands/Islas Malvinas\nthe Far North\nthe Great Plains\nthe Middle East\nthe Midwest (in the U.S.)\nNeotropical\nthe Neotropics\nNew York State (official name; to distinguish it from New York City)\nNorth Africa\nNorth America\nthe North Atlantic\nthe North Pole\nthe Northeast (in the U.S.)\nthe Northern Hemisphere\nthe Northwest (in the U.S.)\nprairie pothole region (of the U.S.)\nthe South (in the U.S.)\nSouth America\nthe South Pole\nthe Southeast (in the U.S.)\nSoutheast Asia\nsouthern Africa\nthe Southern Hemisphere\nthe Southwest (in the U.S.)\nthe subtropics\ntransequatorial\nthe tropics\nthe Upper Peninsula (of Michigan, U.S.)\nupstate New York\nWashington state\nthe West (in the U.S.)\nWest Africa\nthe West Coast (in the U.S.)\nwestern Europe\nthe Western Hemisphere\nthe Western Palearctic\n\nGeographic regions with formal names in languages other than English: Do not capitalize translated English terms like “state” or “department” that are applied to the names of such regions. For example, when discussing regions in South America, use terms like “the department of Antioquia,” “Antioquia department,” “the state of Falcón,” “Arica region,” etc.\nUse a space between coordinates and N, W, S, or E but not between the degree or prime symbols and the following numbers (e.g., 19°29′59″ N, 107°45′36″ W).\nWhen referring to multiple named geographic features, capitalize the plural terms following them, including “Rivers” and “Valleys.” For example, capitalize “Rivers” in “the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.”",

However, do not hyphenate terms including “well” when they appear after a noun, even if Merriam-Webster lists them as hyphenated (e.g., use “the species is well known”).\n\nDo not use hyphens with prefixes like “pre-,” “post-,” “extra-,” “non-,” or “semi-” unless the second element is capitalized, is a year, or starts with the same letter as the last letter of the first element (e.g., “non-native”).\nHyphenate colors according to The Chicago Manual of Style (18th edition): before but not after a noun. Examples:\n\n“red-orange feathers” but “the feathers are red orange”\n“reddish-brown legs” but “the legs are reddish brown”\n“jet-black back” but “the back is jet black”\n“black-and-white feathers” but “the feathers are black and white”\n\nAdverbs ending in “ly” should not be hyphenated, e.g., write “Males produce structurally complex song in hour before dawn” rather than “Males produce a structurally-complex song…” \nUse hyphens when describing ages. For example, “15-day-old nestlings.” The exception is when the period of time in question (e.g., years, months, weeks, or days) is written in plural form, e.g., “…when nestlings are 15 days old.”\nWhen spelling out numbers that appear at the start of sentences, hyphenate all compound numbers from twenty-one through ninety-nine. For example, “Thirty-one nests were assigned to the control group.” \nSpell out fractional numbers &lt; 1, with hyphenation, e.g., “More than one-third of the young with radio transmitters were found dead within a week after leaving the nest.” When fractions are part of numbers &gt; 1, use the numerical form, e.g., “After many years, the width of the nest can be more than 1½ m wide.”",

    "text": "Citas\n\nContributors are welcome to open a section with a quote. When doing so, use quotation marks and provide the author, reference tag, and page number. An example that starts off the Introduction in the Mountain Bluebird account is as follows: “These exquisites, in their quadruple-extract-of-azure garb, are justly ranked the topmost twig of the American ornithological tree.” —William L. Dawson (Dawson 1897: 181)\nWhen quoting material directly from other sources within the main body/text of a section, indicate the page number from which the quote was taken. For example: Criddle (Criddle 1927: 41) wrote that song “…is commenced soon after the first suffusion of light indicates a returning day and is at its height as the rising sun appears over the eastern landscape.” Note the space after the colon.\nAvoid structure such as the following when inserting direct quotes: Wheelock, in her 1904 publication, Birds of California, described the song as “a sweet, clear ‘trually, tru-al-ly’” (p. 507). Such structure makes it difficult to add a reference tag. The preferred structure would be along these lines: In her book, Birds of California, Wheelock (Wheelock 1904: 507) described the song as “a sweet, clear ‘trually, tru-al-ly.’”\nRegarding punctuation following quotes: Following standard U.S. English, place a period or comma inside the quotation marks, e.g., Johnson (1990) referred to this as the “copulation request display.” However, a semicolon or colon should go outside the quotation marks. Question marks and exclamation points go inside the quotation marks if part of the quotation but outside if not.",

    "text": "Estadísticas\n\nStatistics should include, wherever possible, the mean, standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), coefficient of variation (CV), range (lowest–highest), sample size (n), and source of the data. It is fine to report test statistics, a confidence interval (CI), and a p value (p), but these are not used heavily in BOW accounts, with the exception being when contributors report unpublished data and analyses.\nProvide the SD/SE following a ± symbol, without its own units, e.g., “84.8 mL ± 7.0 SD.” SD or SE can be added parenthetically, e.g., “84.8 mL (± 7.0 SD),”but generally do not do so unless added at end of sentence with other statistics.\nWhen naming and reporting a mean, median, range, etc., do not use a colon or equals sign; e.g., use “Mean nest weight 13.7 g ± 0.11 SE (range 6.7–30.0, n = 71).” Note that the units do not need to be repeated for the range.\nNo colon should be used after a descriptor such as length, width, height, or weight that is immediately followed by a number, e.g., “From a sample of 71 nests in Arkansas: outside length 15.0 cm ± 0.41 SE (range 9.0–27.0); outside width 12.8 cm ± 0.24 SE (range 8.5–18.5)…”\nUse an en dash (–) for a range of numbers (e.g., “29–35 mm,” “from 1–20 July,” or “3–4 eggs”). To insert an en dash, use the Option and hyphen keys on a Mac or the Control and hyphen keys on a PC. These symbols can be used in the find and replace function (see Paso 3: Comprender la barra de menús del editor) if one needs to replace a large number of hyphens with en dashes.\nWhen reporting multiple descriptive statistics, separate each by commas, not semicolons, e.g., “Parents made, on average, 16.4 trips/h to the nest to feed young (± 8.8 SD, range 6–25, n = 53 nests).” \nWhen reporting results of statistical tests, report the test statistic first, the p value second, and the sample size last, e.g., “The number of days young spent in the nest was inversely related to mean brood wing length on day 13 of the nestling stage (r = −0.61, p = 0.03, n = 45 broods).”\nUse a minus sign (−), not a hyphen, to denote negative numbers.",

    "text": "Abdomen: The flattish posterior region on the underside of the trunk, approximately from the posterior end of the sternum to the vent.\nAdult: A bird whose feathering does not change in aspect in subsequent plumage cycles (i.e., definitive). Such an individual is normally capable of breeding, but the converse often does not hold true; birds of many species breed, some even more than once, before attaining definitive feathering. In other cases, birds may not breed in the first year of acquiring definitive plumage. Hence, breeding status itself is not a practicable criterion for adulthood. In case of possible ambiguity, define what you mean.\nAfro-Eurasia: The landmass comprising Africa, Asia, and Europe. This term is preferable to “Old World.”\nAlar tract: All the feathering on the wing, including the remiges and their coverts on the upper sides and undersides but not the scapulohumeral tract, from which it is separated by the humeral apterium.\nAlternate plumage: The name of the second plumage when there are two plumages per plumage cycle. The first plumage (i.e., the basic plumage) usually is a more complete molt and usually results in a plumage that is less brightly/conspicuously colored than alternate plumage. May be numbered first, second, etc., to designate changes in color and molt pattern until the definitive stage is reached. Acquired by a prealternate molt that usually replaces only body feathers, not remiges and rectrices.\nAltricial: The character of a young bird that is helpless when hatched and requires considerable rearing before it can leave the nest. Upon hatching, such a nestling is either naked or sparsely downy, and its eyes are closed.\nAlular digit: The anterior digit of the wing, represented by a single short bone on the leading edge of the carpometacarpus. Formerly called the pollex.\nAlular quills: Small, narrow, stiff contour feathers attached to the alular digit on the upper side of the wrist. Collectively known as the alula or bastard wing.\nAmplitude: The maximum excursion of air pressure from ambient pressure in a cycle of a sound wave. An objective measurement of sound, it is not an equivalent for “loudness” (q.v.).\nAnisodactyl: The arrangement of the toes in which the hallux is behind and the other three toes are in front, as in passerines.\nAnnual reproductive success: A measure of the breeding output of a population sample in one season, calculated as either the number of broods reared divided by the number of breeding females in the population, or as the number of young reared to nest leaving divided by the number of females in the sample (specify). This should be clearly distinguished from lifetime reproductive success, the number of offspring of an individual surviving at a given time.\nApterium (plural: apteria): An area of the body without contour feathers, either bare or sparsely furnished with down feathers or semiplumes.\nAttenuation: The decrease in amplitude of a signal during its transmission from one place to another.\nAuriculars: A patch of feathers around the ear opening and often screening it.They may be of coarser texture than the adjacent contour feathers. Synonym: ear coverts.\nBack: The anterior two-thirds of the region on the upper side of the trunk between the base of the neck and the base of the tail.\nBasic plumage: The name of the plumage generally acquired by a complete molt in adults (usually near or after breeding), and by an incomplete molt in juveniles, into a “nonbreeding” plumage, but there are some exceptions. May be numbered first, second, etc., to designate changes in color and pattern until the definitive state is reached. Acquired by a prebasic molt. If the plumage cycle consists of a single generation, it is always basic.\nBooted: The character of the horny covering of the tarsus in which it is smooth, without scales or plates.\nBoreal: Pertaining to cool or cold temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, the northern coniferous zone and taiga.\nBreast: The rounded, anterior region on the underside of the trunk, between the lower border of the jugulum and the approximate posterior end of the sternum.\nBreeding site fidelity: The tendency for a bird to breed at the same site consecutively.\nBristle: A feather with a stiff, tapered rachis and barbs only along the proximal portion. “Semibristles” are intermediate between bristles and contour feathers, having a conspicuous rachis, barbs along the entire rachis but widely spaced near the tip, and barbules very small or absent on most of the barbs.\nCalls: Vocal displays; stereotyped sounds used in communication. Generally, calls are short and simple, whereas songs are long and complex, but the distinction is not exact. Also, calls may be produced at any time, while songs often are given primarily in the breeding season. A species typically has 5–20 calls.\nCanopy: The uppermost stratum of foliage in forest vegetation; formed by the crowns of the trees and subdivided into two or three levels in rainforests.\nCapital tract: The pteryla that extends over the top of the head from the base of the upper mandible posteriorly to the point where the head and neck join. It is bounded on each side by an imaginary line passing from the mandibular ramus to the angle of the jaw. May be subdivided into subordinate tracts.\nCaudal tract: All the feathers of the tail, including the rectrices, the uppertail and undertail coverts, and any feathering on the uropygial gland.\nChick: The life stage of a precocial young bird, i.e., well covered with down, leaving the nest, and able to feed itself.\nChin: The area, usually feathered, in the fork on the underside of the bill. Synonym: interramal region.\nCommissure: The line along which the mandibles come together. The place on each side of the mouth where the mandibles come together is the “commissural point” (synonym: angle of the mouth).\nCommunal singing: Interactive singing by members of a social group.\nComplete body molt: Replacement of all contour (body) feathers but no flight feathers (remiges or rectrices).\nComplete molt: Replacement of all body and flight feathers. \nContinental shelf: The shallow, gradually sloping seabed around a continental margin, not usually deeper than 200 m and formed by submergence of part of the continent. Beyond it, the continental slope falls steeply toward the ocean bottom.\nContour feather: A feather with closely knit, flat vanes, forming the outer covering of the body; does not include the flight feathers (remiges and rectrices).\nCooperative polyandry: Amating system in which a single female and a group of males form a communal breeding unit in which all males have an opportunity for mating.\nCountersinging: “Counter-replies,” sometimes alternating and sometimes overlapping, of song by two or more individuals that are responding to each other.\nCoverts: Contour feathers that overlie or underlie the bases of the remiges and rectrices and cover the rest of the wing or tail; usually smaller than the flight feathers.\nCrown: The posterior, upper region of the head, behind an imaginary line joining the anterior corners of the eyes. Adjective: coronal.\n\n\n\nCrural tract: The feathering on theleg below the knee, separated from the femoral tract by a narrow apterium.\nCulmen: The ridgeline of the upper mandible, from the forehead to the tip of the bill.\nCycle: Sound: A complete repetition of a waveform. Reproduction: The period from courtship until the rearing of independent young (or reproductive failure).\nDecibel (dB): A unit used tocompare the intensity of two sounds. The decibel scale is logarithmic. One decibel corresponds to an intensity ratio of approximately 1.26, 3 decibels to a ratio of approximately 2, and 10 decibels to a ratio of exactly 10. Measurements in decibels should refer to the base against which they are calculated. In most cases, the reference unit is 20 micropascals (or equivalents), but it can be calculated differently.\nDefinitive: Typically, “adult” plumage. The condition of a plumage such that it does not change further with age, i.e., plumages in the same stage of subsequent plumage cycles are identical. May be applied to basic, alternate, or supplemental plumages.\nDegradation: The change in the form of a sound as it travels from its source. It is caused by differential attenuation of different frequencies of sound, refraction of sound passing through volumes of air of different densities, reflection of sound off surfaces, and diffraction of sound passing through gaps and around barriers.\nDialect: Microgeographic variation in a sound signal resulting from imitation by members of a local population. Sharp boundaries between local dialects can often be identified, though boundaries may differ depending on the features considered in drawing those boundaries.\nDispersal: The act or process by which individuals move from their place of birth to a place of (potential) breeding.\nDispersion: Ecology: The pattern of distribution of individuals within a population, as clumped or aggregated, uniform, or random. Statistics: The distribution or scatter of observations about the mean or central value.\nDorsal tract: The pteryla that extends posteriorly from the capital tract to the uppertail coverts. Along the neck, it is bordered on each side by a cervical apterium; along the trunk, it is bordered on each side by a large lateral apterium. The dorsal tract is divisible into four regions: the “cervical region” from the head to the trunk; the narrow “interscapular region,” which extends posteriorly between the shoulder blades; the saddle-shaped “dorsal region” from the shoulder blades to a point approximately halfway to the tail; and the broad “pelvic region” between the hips from the dorsal region to the tail coverts.\nDown feather: A general term for a fluffy or lax feather in which the rachis is usually short or absent, at least shorter than the longest barb. There are two major categories. (1) “Natal downs”: on newly hatched birds of many species (synonym: nestling downs); include neossoptile (first natal down) and mesoptile (second natal down). (2) “Definitive downs”:  on immature and adult birds, beneath the contour feathers (synonym: adult downs). “Down” may be applied either to individual feathers or to the plumage composed of them.\nDuetting: Overlapping bouts of vocal or nonvocal sounds by members of a mated pair or extended family group. The degree of precision in the contributions of the participants varies.\nEgg dumping: The laying of eggs in the nest of another female (usually of the same species) without providing care for those eggs or the resulting young. Synonym: dump nesting.\nEurasia: The continental area comprising Europe and Asia.\nEyering: A ring of feathers around the eye, often distinctively colored. To be distinguished from “orbital ring” (q.v.).\nFeather coat: The total complement of feathers on a bird at any given time, regardless of how many generations of feathers (plumages) combine to produce that appearance. For example, the feathering of many birds during the breeding season comprises both basic and alternate plumages.\nFemale access polyandry: A mating system in which females do not defend resources essential to males but through interactions among themselves may limit access to males. The system most closely resembles an explosive breeding assemblage (Emlen and Oring 1977) in which the operational sex ratio may become skewed with an excess of females.\nFemale (or harem) defense polygyny: A mating system in which individual males control access to multiple females directly, usually by virtue of female gregariousness.\nFemoral tract: A tract on the outer surface of each thigh, from the knee (and hip) nearly to the vent.\nFiloplume: A slender, hair-like feather with a small tuft of barbs or barbules at the tip.\nFlank: The region on either side of the trunk dorsolateral to the abdomen.\nFledge: The process of acquiring the feathers necessary for flight and the ability to fly. When complete, the bird is fledged. Not synonymous with nest departure. Do not apply the term to the parental process of rearing young until they can fly.\nFledging success: A measure of breeding output in a population sample, calculated as the fraction or percentage of total eggs laid that produced young that left the nest, including additional broods, if any.\nFledgling: The life stage of an altricial bird from the time it leaves the nest until it becomes independent of its parents. The term is restricted to species in which the young do not leave the nest until they are fully feathered and ready to fly.\nForehead: The anterior, upper region of the head, above the lores, that extends up and back from the bill to an imaginary line joining the anterior corners of the eyes. Adjective: frontal.\nForest: A relatively large area of closely canopied trees, mainly taller than 5 m. A small stand of trees may be termed a grove.\nFormative Plumage: A novel plumage in the first cycle between the Juvenile (First Basic) Plumage and the next alternate or basic plumage.\nFourier analysis: A technique for analyzing sounds in which a wave is sampled at some relatively high rate (at least 2.5× the highest frequency to be resolved), and the value of the wave at each of these points is assigned a specific digital value. Digitized information is then subjected to a Fourier analysis that provides a sound spectrum appearing as frequency on the x-axis and amplitude on the r-axis. Hence, each sound spectrogram represents a temporal slice through the sound that gives a reasonably precise portrayal of frequency and amplitude for a given instant. The duration of that instant varies with the range of frequencies to be sampled.\nFrequency: The number of complete cycles of a periodic process occurring per unit time. A parameter for a sound wave, it is an objective measurement and thus not equivalent to “pitch” (q.v.). Usually measured as a number of cycles/second = hertz (Hz). The fundamental is the lowest frequency of a harmonic series.\nGonys: The ridge formed by the junction of the two rami of the lower mandible near its tip.\nGrassland: A major biotic community in temperate regions consisting of flat to rolling, treeless, grass-covered terrain. The climate is subject to abrupt seasonal changes, with winters being cold to very cold, and rainfall is moderate to low.\nGular region: A region on the underside of the head that continues from the chin to an imaginary line between the angles of the jaw.\nHabituation: Waning of response to a stimulus over time.\nHallux: The first toe, usually directed backward and reduced, sometimes absent.\nHarmonics: Components of a periodic wave that are integral multiples of the lowest (or fundamental) frequency, which is the first harmonic; the component whose frequency is twice that of the fundamental is the second harmonic, and so on. Harmonics may be overtones, but overtones are not harmonics. The overtone frequency is derived from the fundamental, but the mathematical relationship to the fundamental is not simple.\nHatching success: A measure of breeding output in a population sample, calculated as the fraction or percent of the total number of eggs laid that hatched, including additional broods, if any. This should be distinguished from hatching rate, which is the fraction or percentage of nests in an observed sample in which at least one egg hatched.\nHeterodactyl: The arrangement of the toes in which the third and fourth are in front and the first (hallux) and second behind, as in trogons.\nHome range: The total area that a bird occupies during the breeding season or during the nonbreeding season, but excluding the area traversed during migration or dispersal. It may (1) be the same as “territory” (q.v.), (2) be the territory plus an outside area that the bird frequents for food or other needs, or (3) contain no territory.\nImmature: A general term for any young bird from the time it acquires Juvenile Plumage until it acquires fully adult (i.e., definitive) feathering. It does not connote sexual immaturity unless so specified because immatures of some species may be capable of breeding. Immature is synonymous with juvenile except that the latter connotes sexual immaturity.\nInshore: A coastal zone arbitrarily defined as extending 5 km out from the low-water mark. Where there are islands or islets well in sight of the shore, all intervening water and the zone up to 5 km beyond them should be included as inshore, as should seas of a depth less than 15 cm.\nIntensity: The power delivered per unit area in a sound wave. Intensity is usually expressed in decibels (q.v.) relative to 1,012 W/m2, which is approximately the threshold of human hearing.\nInterspecific territoriality: The persistent aggressive behavior exhibited by a territory holder of one species toward members of another species. Involves some, if not all, of the behaviors usually involved in intraspecific encounters.\nIris (plural: irises or irides): A thin membrane in the front of the eye that, by its state of contraction, determines the size of the aperture (pupil) in its center.\nJugulum: The region on the underside of the neck from the posterior margin of the gular region to the trunk.\nJuvenile Plumage: The first generation of true (pennaceous) contour feathers. The feathers are usually less closely knit and differently colored than those that will follow. Acquired by the Prejuvenile Molt (i.e., replacement of Natal Down in species that have a downy plumage). Equivalent to the First Basic Plumage.\nKilohertz (kHz): Unit of measurement for frequency of sound waves; equivalent to 1,000 Hz, or 1,000 cycles per second.\nLek: A communal display ground where males congregate for the sole purpose of attracting and courting females and to which females come for mating. Synonym: arena. The term may also be applied to a communal prenuptial display on such an area, specifically one involving ritualized contests among competitors, often for the rise of symbolic sites.\nLittoral: (1) The shore of a lake to a depth of about 10 m. (2) The intertidal zone of the seashore, extended or alternatively employed for nontidal waters, to include the underwater limit to which the more abundant attached plants can grow, sometimes to a depth of 3 m or more, corresponding to light penetration. May thus overlap the inshore zone at subsurface levels.\nLobate: The character of a swimming foot with a series of lateral lobes on the toes, as in grebes. Sometimes the foot may be palmate, but the hallux may bear a lobe, as in diving ducks.\nLore: The area between the eyelid and the eyering and the base of the upper part of the bill.\nLoudness: The perception of the strength of a sound. For sounds that differ only in amplitude, relative loudness is directly related to relative intensity, but for sounds that differ in frequency and temporal characters, loudness is a complicated psychophysical phenomenon. It depends not only on characteristics of the stimulating wave form but also on the reaction properties of the mechanical receiving system (ear) and neurological analyses. The relative loudness of different sounds may be different for humans and various species of birds.\nMacrogeographic variation: Variation over geographic distances sufficiently large that birds from those locations have minimal contact with each other, generally on the order of hundreds or thousands of kilometers. May refer to features of the body, eggs, habits, or sounds.\nMajor digit: The main digit of the wing, represented by the two phalanges in line with the carpometacarpus.\nMalar region: The region on the side of the head from the base of the lower part of the bill to the angle of the jaw; it is bounded above by the lore, orbital region, and auricular region and below by the edge of the lower jaw.\nMale dominance polygyny: A mating system in which mates or critical resources are not able to be economically monopolized. Males compete for females by sorting out positions of dominance and/or directly demonstrating quality through display.\nMantle: Used when the back, scapulars, and wing coverts together present an area of distinctive color.\nMate: An individual with which another individual shares gametes. (A mate can be pair bonded or not.)\nMean: Average; equal to the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations (denoted as a statistic of a sample by x, and as a population parameter by µ; arithmetic mean).\nMesoptile: Down feathers of the second downy plumage in species that have one.\nMicrogeographic variation: Variation on a small enough geographic scale that young birds may be expected to disperse from one place to another, generally on the order of a few kilometers. Usually used in reference to vocalizations.\nMigration: The regular movement of an individual or group between geographically separate, seasonal ranges. Within a species, populations may vary in the extent of their migration, and within a population, individuals may vary likewise.\nMigratory restlessness: The unsettled behavior of birds immediately before they are due to depart on migration, also called premigratory restlessness or the original German term, “Zugunruhe.”\nMimicry: The close resemblance of one organism (the mimic) to another (or to a natural object, the model) to deceive a third (the operator). May be applied to interspecific appearance or sound learning (q.v.).\nMinor digit: The posterior digit of the wing, represented by a single, small phalanx behind the proximal end of the basal phalanx of the main digit.\nModulation: Any periodic change in the frequency, amplitude, or phase of a sound wave.\nMolt: The regular loss of part or all of the feather coat and replacement of it by a generation of feathers or other integumentary derivatives, whether this includes all or only a portion of the bird. Molts are named in relation to the incoming plumage, i.e., prebasic, prealternate, etc. A molt may be limited in time, protracted, or even interrupted. It may also be either complete (i.e., renewing all tracts) or partial (i.e., renewing only some tracts).\nMolt migration: A regular movement in certain species from the breeding grounds to sheltered areas where the birds molt.\nMonogamy: A mating relationship in which a male or a female is mated to a single individual during theperiod of one reproductive cycle.\nNape: The region on the upper part of the neck, from the posterior margin of the crown to the trunk.\nNatal Down: The plumage of down feathers, sparse or abundant, that first clothes a nestling, either present at hatching or appearing within a few days. Birds of a few orders have two successive generations of natal downs. Lost by the Prejuvenile Molt.\nNatal philopatry: The tendency of a mature bird to return to its site of hatching for its first breeding effort.\nNeossoptile (neoptile): Feathers of the first (usually only) downy plumage.\nNest success: A measure of breeding output in a population sample, calculated as the fraction or percentage of total nests that produced young that left the nest, including additional broods, if any. Contrast with “fledging success” (q.v.).\nNestling: The life stage of a young bird while it remains in the nest.\nNomadic: The characteristic of individuals moving irregularly from place to place in response to rainfall, drought, or the emergence of food.\nNon-native species: A species living outside its native distributional range that has arrived there by human activity, either deliberate or accidental.\nNonvocal sounds: Sounds produced by the bill, feet, or feathers, perhaps used for communication. Synonym: mechanical sounds.\nNotched: A character of a primary remex in which one or both vanes are incised toward the tip. Synonym: emarginate.\nNote: A single tone of definite pitch. The term is often used more broadly in reference to a single continuous trace on a sound spectrogram. Synonyms: phone, figure, and element. If you use these synonyms, define them unambiguously.\nOcciput: The posterior portion of the crown (q.v.), usually not distinguished unless the feathering differs from that of adjacent regions. Adjective: occipital.\nOffshore: The coastal zone that extends from the limits of inshore waters to the edge of the continental shelf or continental slope.\nOperculum: A horny flap covering the nostril.\nOrbital ring: A ring of bare skin around the eye. To be distinguished from “eyering” (q.v.).\nPalmate: The character of the toes in which the anterior three are united by extensive webs, as in ducks and gulls. Synonym: webbed.\nPamprodactyl: The arrangement of the toes in which all four are in front, the hallux being turned forward, as in swifts.\nPelagic: The zone of the deep ocean, beyond the continental slope.\nPennaceous: Feathers in which the barbs of each vane are parallel and interlocked with one another via barbules on adjacent barbs, i.e., typical body feathers.\nPhrase: A seemingly natural segment of a song, such as a sequence of similar syllables or a group of dissimilar notes bounded by either repeated syllables or by the beginning or end of a song. Alternatively, the term may refer to the repeated unit (“syllable”) in a song. Define your use of this term unambiguously.\nPitch: The perception of the relative frequency of a sound, dependent on frequency, loudness, and intensity. For sounds with a fundamental frequency and harmonic series, pitch corresponds to a frequency (at least in humans), but for other sounds the perception of pitch is a complicated psychophysical process. Unlike frequency (q.v.). pitch can be modified by characteristics of the receiving system. The pitch of sounds may be perceived differently by humans and various species of birds, and even by different individuals within a species.\nPlumage: A single generation of feathers, resulting from a single molt. Plumages are named Natal Down, juvenile, formative, basic, alternate, and supplemental. The total feathering worn by a bird (which one typically thinks of as its “plumage”) is usually composed of multiple plumages and is referred to as the feather coat.\nPlumage cycle: The period in an “adult” bird that extends from a given plumage or molt to the next occurrence of the same plumage or molt. Lasts one year in most temperate-zone species, but it is shorter in some tropical and oceanic species and longer in a few species at various latitudes.\nPolyandry: A mating relationship in which one female is mated to two or more monogamous males during one reproductive cycle.\nPolygyny: A mating relationship in which one male is mated to two or more monogamous females whose reproductive cycles overlap.\nPolygynandry: A mating relationship in which both males and females are mated to two or more members of the opposite sex during a single reproductive cycle.\nPowder-down feather: A modified feather, usually with the structure of a down, that produces a fine, talc-like powder by the proliferation and keratinization of cells that surround the barbs in the feather germ. Such feathers in different species are either dispersed among ordinary downs and contour feathers or clustered in specific areas called “powder-down patches.”\nPrecocial: The opposite of altricial (q.v.). Hatches with a heavy coat of down, is mobile soon after hatching, and requires little direct parental care.\nPrealternate molt: The molt that brings in the alternate plumage, if any.\nPrebasic molt: The molt that brings in the basic plumage, commonly taken as the starting point of a plumage cycle.\nPreformative Molt: The molt that brings in the Formative Plumage, if any.\nPrejuvenile Molt: The molt that brings in the Juvenile Plumage. Equivalent to the First Prebasic Molt.\nPresupplemental Molt: The molt that brings in the Supplemental Plumage, if any; it may follow either a basic or an alternate plumage.\nPsilopaedic: Hatches naked (with little or no down).\nPteryla (plural: pterylae): An area of the body bearing rows of contour feathers. Synonym: tract.\nPtilopaedic: Hatches with a dense coat of down.\nRachis: The central shaft of a feather to which the barbs attach.\nRami (mandibular) (singular: ramus): The two halves of the lower mandible, separated by soft tissue near the base (commissure) but uniting anteriorly in the gonys.\nRapid double-clutch monogamy: A mating relationship in which a female lays two clutches in succession, one incubated by her mate and the other by herself.\nRapid multiple-clutch polygamy: A mating relationship in which a female lays at least two clutches with different mates and the male fertilizes at least two clutches for different mates in rapid succession. Males and females incubate separate clutches.\nRaptorial: The character of the toes in which they are deeply cleft, with large, strong, sharply curved nails, as in hawks.\nRectrices (singular: rectrix): Flight feathers of the tail.\nRemiges (singular: remex): The long, stiff feathers that project posteriorly from the wings, anchored to the bones of the forelimb. Two main series: primary remiges (“primaries”) attach to the hand bones, and secondary remiges (“secondaries”) attach to the ulna. True tertials (not inner secondaries), if any, attach to the humerus.\nRepertoire: The variety of sounds that an individual uses in communication. Often refers in a more restricted sense to the diversity of song types that an individual bird uses.\nResident: The characteristic of a species or population that is basically nonmigratory.\nResource defense polyandry: A mating system in which individual females control access to males indirectly, by monopolizing critical resources.\nResource defense polygyny: A mating system in which individual males control access to multiple females indirectly, by monopolizing critical resources.\nReticulate: A character of the horny covering of the tarsus in which it is formed into small irregular plates.\nRictus: The soft, fleshy, posterior portion of the tomium near the commissural point.\nRiparian woodland: A biotic community, mostly of deciduous trees, near streams or bottomlands where there is an adequate supply of subsurface water; especially prominent in the more arid sections of the southwestern United States.\nRump: The posterior one-third of the region on the upper side of the trunk between the base of the neck and the base of the tail. Synonym: pelvic region.\nSavanna: A tropical and subtropical grassland biotic community, transitional between grassland or desert and rainforest, typically with drought-resistant vegetation dominated by grasses with scattered tall trees; tends to be semiarid with few or no wetlands and should be at least seminatural and in sizeable tracts.\nScapulohumeral tract: A narrow pteryla on the upper side of each shoulder, across the joint or just distal to it.\nSclerophyll: A type of vegetation adapted to hot and dry conditions. Sclerophyllous plants typically have small and tough leaves.\nScutellate: The character of the horny covering of the tarsus in which it is formed into more or less overlapping scales.\nScutellate-booted: The character of the horny covering of the tarsus in which it has overlapping scales in front but is smooth behind.\nScutellate-reticulate: The character of the horny covering of the tarsus in which it has overlapping scales in front and small irregular plates behind.\nSemialtricial: The character of a young bird that is down covered when hatched, is unable to leave the nest for a few weeks, and is fed by its parents.\nSemipalmate: The character of the toes in which the anterior three are joined partway by small webbing.\nSemiplume: A downy feather with a large rachis, i.e., longer than the longest barb. Structurally intermediate between a contour feather and a down feather.\nSemiprecocial: The character of a young bird that is down covered when hatched, leaves the nest soon afterward, and moves a short distance away while still fed by its parents.\nSerrate: The property of having a saw-like edge, either on the tomia of the bill or the horny covering of the tarsus.\nSong: A vocalization in which one or more sounds are consistently repeated in a specific and often complex pattern. It is usually uttered from conspicuous perches, most frequently by males (at least in temperate regions) during the breeding season. The foregoing definition is subject to exceptions. Song is believed to serve in attracting/stimulating a mate and in defending a territory, but those functions should not be assumed without solid evidence.\nSonogram: The general term for a graph of sound frequency against time, with intensity indicated by the darkness of the graph. Do not confuse with “sonagram,” a graph of this type produced specifically on the Sona-graph Instrument (Kay Elemetrics Co.). Also, avoid applying this term to sound spectrograms of other variables, such as those made by fast Fourier analysis.\nSound learning (sound imitation): An adaptive change in sound-making behavior that results from experience. It is often a two-stage process in which an animal first memorizes a sound and later produces good copies of that original. A bird may learn to recognize a neighbor’s vocalizations and yet not vocalize those sounds; this is not “sound learning.” Be sure to use “sound learning” or “vocal learning” in an unambiguous way.\nSound spectrogram: A graph produced by any process that resolves sound in such a way as to show at what frequencies energy is distributed. With frequency on the x-axis, the y-axis may be either time, as in a sonogram, or amplitude, as in a Fourier transformation. Synonym: audio spectrogram.\nSparse vegetation: Plants are spaced more than twice as far apart as their diameter. Distinguished from “open vegetation,” which describes plants that are, on average, separated by less than their diameter, and from “closed vegetation,” where they are in contact or overlap. These terms relate to whichever layer of vegetation shows the most complete coverage.\nSubsong: Earliest “motor” stage of song development, during which a young bird is beginning to utter sounds that will eventually become adult songs.\nSupercilium: A horizontal stripe of distinctively colored plumage on the side of the head above the eye.\nSupplemental Plumage: The name of any plumage that occurs in a plumage cycle in addition to the basic and alternate plumages (i.e., it is not homologous to either basic or alternate plumage). It may precede or follow the alternate plumage. Acquired by a Presupplemental Molt.\nSyndactyl: The arrangement of the toes in which the third (middle) and fourth (outer) are partly united with a single broad sole, as in kingfishers.\nSyllable: A repeated unit in a song. If using this term, define it unambiguously.\nTaiga: Northern, dense, predominantly coniferous forest, little disturbed or dissected and often containing swampy areas. Occupies the broad belt south of the tundra in upper mid-latitudes.\nTerritory: A space within which an individual is aggressive toward, and usually dominant over, certain categories of intruders. May be roughly classified as either breeding or nonbreeding territory, with several types in each (Pettingill 1985: 259). Not to be confused with “home range” (q.v.).\nTibiotarsal joint: The backward-pointing joint in the leg between the tibiotarsus (tibia) and the tarsometatarsus (tarsus). It is not the knee, the joint between the femur and the tibiotarsus, which is usually concealed by the feathering and musculature of the thigh. Synonyms: intertarsal joint, ankle.\nTomium (plural: tomia): The cutting edge of the upper or lower mandible. \nTonal quality: What distinguishes one sound from another of the same frequency. Physically, tonal quality is determined by the presence or absence of harmonics and their relative intensity and distribution, by transients, and by the rate and range of frequency and/or amplitude modulation. Synonym: timbre.\nTotipalmate: The character of the toes in which all four are united by large webs, as in cormorants.\nTundra: A major biotic community characterized by a lack of trees, and short, cool summers; permafrost below a surface layer is subject to summer melt. Dominant plants include lichens, mosses, sedges, grasses, and low shrubs. “Arctic tundra” occupies the arctic region, i.e., north of the 10°C isotherm, where the mean temperature of the warmest month falls below that value and tree growth is not possible. “Alpine tundra” is above the treeline of high mountains (e.g., ~3,050 m in the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada–Cascade system).\nVariety: The sequential presentation of song types in a repertoire. If successive songs in a performance are of different types, a bird is said to sing with “immediate variety”; if a bird repeats one song type many times before switching to another song type, the bird is said to sing with “eventual variety.”\nVentral tract: The pteryla on the underside of the body, from the junction of the mandibular rami to the circlet of feathers around the vent. In different species, it may enclose a midventral apterium or be more or less divisible into such tracts as the cervical, pectoral, sternal, and abdominal.\nVertical displacement: The characteristic of a species or population whose individuals regularly shift their elevational range in mountains. Synonym: altitudinal migration.\nVocal convergence: The tendency for two or more birds to converge on similar vocal signals, usually as a result of vocal learning.\nVocalization: Inclusive term for all avian sounds produced by the syrinx, in contrast to “nonvocal sounds” (q.v.).\nWestern Palearctic: One of eight biogeographic realms, including mostly boreal and temperate climate ecoregions. It comprises northern Africa, the northern and central Arabian Peninsula, part of temperate Asia, and Europe. Its exact boundaries may vary by source.\nWhistle: A sound that most nearly approaches a pure tone, i.e., with a fundamental and no overtones.\nWoodland: An open stand of trees, usually less than 15 m tall, too widely spaced to form a continuous canopy, and with an intervening growth of grasses or shrubs.\nZygodactyl: The arrangement of the toes in which the second and third are in front and the first (hallux) and fourth are behind, as in woodpeckers.",

    "text": "Imágenes\nThe main image gallery and the images on each page of the account will be curated and added to the revision by BOW staff. You will be able to review all images in the revision prior to publication. We welcome author suggestions for images (see instructions below).\nPlease note, if you absolutely do not want BOW staff to populate the media galleries for your account, you must supply suitable gallery content consistent with BOW media standards and procedures yourself. We strongly recommend that you communicate extensively with BOW staff about your selections, as any media that fail to meet BOW media standards of content, size, quality, account organization, etc., will be omitted or replaced, without exception.\n\nEnvíe sus propias imágenes\nIf you have specific images that you would like to contribute to your BOW account, they must be uploaded to our content management system via eBird/Macaulay Library. Note, you should only contribute images for which you are the photographer. If you would like to add images by others to your BOW revision, each individual photographer will need to upload their own work (even if you have the photographer’s permission to use the image in a BOW account).\nAlthough we absolutely encourage you to dig into eBird as deeply as you would like, for many BOW contributors, eBird will simply be an intake mechanism to allow you to upload images into a stable repository that archives and displays the best quality/largest size of an image, alongside organized, searchable metadata.\nTo submit images to eBird/Macaulay Library, you will need to determine the best eBird protocol to use.\nWe strongly encourage any media submissions to abide by eBird and the Macaulay Library’s best practices for data and media; however, BOW authors who are interested only in adding images specifically for a BOW revision are under no obligation to enter “complete” eBird checklists. In eBird parlance, a complete checklist includes observation data for all of the species you were able to identify for a given location and date. Complete checklists are considered scientifically valid and thus must conform to a set of replicable standards. There is considerably more flexibility when adding media to an “incomplete” checklist.\nThe simplest way to upload media intended for an incomplete checklist is to use your BOW username/password to login to eBird. Select the “Submit” tab and indicate a location. On the next screen, enter the date the image was taken, and then select either a “Historical” or “Incidental” protocol.\n\nIf you choose Historical, you need to know only the location and date of your image(s). You will be given the option to enter other metadata about your observations, but you do not have to fill out those fields. Once you are on the checklist screen, you can enter the quantity of your species (or “X,” if unknown) and click the “Add Details” button that pops up. There, you can drag and drop your image(s) into the “Media” field. Make sure to indicate that you are not submitting a complete checklist (there is a prompt before you can submit). You can find additional information on this protocol here.\nIf you choose Incidental, then you will need to know the location, date, time, and party size. Enter the quantity of your species (or “X,” if unknown), click the “Add Details” button, and drag and drop your image(s) into the “Media” field. You’ll notice that “incomplete checklist” has already been selected for you.\n\nUsing these two protocols, it is fine to enter older media and to keep your checklist as simple as possible.\nSimilarly, it is fine (and encouraged!) for BOW authors to submit habitat images or other sorts of media that are atypical for eBird. You can now submit checklist-level media, including habitat photos that do not include birds, to an eBird list. Habitat photos should be tagged with birds observed in that habitat, which allows users to search for such photos in the Macaulay Library by clicking the “Habitat/Soundscape” button above the search bar. You can also search for habitat photos by location. If you have an image that does include the bird but primarily showcases the habitat rather than the bird itself, please upload it to your eBird checklist under the relevant bird species and use the “Habitat” tag. Photos of birds in the hand can also be uploaded to an eBird checklist under the relevant species; please use the “In-hand” tag to make these images easier to find.\nNote: If you would like to use photos of museum specimens in a BOW account, these should not be uploaded to eBird. Please contact Maria Smith (mgs248@cornell.edu) for information on how to have these images added to the account as figures.\nUpload your photos at their original resolution, whenever possible. eBird accepts images up to 10 MB in size, and each species on a checklist can accept 10 images. Please do not include watermarks on your images.\nOnce you have uploaded your images, please provide the eBird checklist and/or Macaulay Library asset numbers (e.g., ML36340541), as well as a Word document with titles and captions for each image to be included (material must be received no later than one month prior to publication of the account). You can upload this information to the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish) or send it to Maria Smith (mgs248@cornell.edu). Please see recently published accounts for examples of the format and content of image titles and captions.\nIf you would like to submit your own images, we are particularly interested in:\n\nImages that can be used for identification of sexes, age classes, and subspecies\nImages that demonstrate important aspects of behavior (e.g., displays, interactions, or foraging) and natural history (e.g., nests or eggs)\nImages that show anatomical details (e.g., spread wing, molt, bare parts, or portrait)\nImages that portray coarse- and fine-scale habitat features\nImages that depict conservation issues and/or human interactions with the species\n\n\n\nSelección de imágenes que ya están en la Biblioteca Macaulay\nWe also invite you to peruse the Macaulay Library (http://macaulaylibrary.org) for images to be included in your account. Some images in the Macaulay Library may be too small/low quality for inclusion in BOW, so it is useful to double check the size before suggesting an image. If you find images that you would like to include in your account, please provide the eBird checklist and/or Macaulay Library asset numbers (e.g., ML36340541), as well as a Word document with titles and captions for each image to be included (material must be received no later than one month prior to publication of the account).

    "text": "If completing a full revision, attempt to include information for all relevant sections of the account (see Appendix 2 for a list of sections and Appendix 3 for guidance on each section).\nCheck the Additional References on the References page of the account for any sources you might have missed during your literature search. This is especially important for accounts originally published in HBW since these typically did not involve an exhaustive survey of the literature.\nCite all statements in the account with a “reference tag” (see Step 5: Linking and Adding References), or note if the source of that statement is unpublished data, a personal observation, a personal communication, or an observation from eBird or a similar project (see References/Citations).\n\nException: Avoid using references in the Introduction unless you are providing a quotation or information that is not included elsewhere in the account.\nIf no published information is available, please note “Information needed.”\nIf you are preparing a full revision but did not evaluate a section, please note “This section was not evaluated.”\n\nFormat all new references that you have added according to BOW style (see Appendix 5). \nScan through the Literature Cited on the References page for any duplicated references (ordering the references alphabetically can be helpful) and replace as needed in the account text (see Step 5: Linking and Adding References).\nEnsure that any headings (e.g., text formatted as Heading 1 or Heading 2) are not bolded.\nUse “species tags” for all references to bird names (see Referring to Species).\n\nFor the focal species, use the common name only (except when use of the scientific name is more helpful, such as on some parts of the Systematics page).\nFor species other than the focal species, provide the scientific name and link to the BOW account the first time the species is named in each section of the account. For subsequent mentions of that species in the same section, use the common name only. For short pages, you may provide the scientific name and link only the first time the species is named on the page (rather than in each section).\n\nDo not use an s or *‘s* after a species tag to make the species name plural or possessive, respectively. Our translation process does not support this. Instead, reframe the sentence to use the singular of the species’ name.\nEnsure that the focal species is mentioned at the beginning of each page. Avoid beginning a page or section with “It,” as it should first be made clear that “it” refers to the focal species.\nUse lowercase for common names of nonbird species (but still capitalize proper nouns, e.g., Central American, European).\nEnsure that information in the first section on each page (i.e., the section that does not have a heading and is labeled “(introduction)” in Appendix 2) provides a general summary of the information on the page without repeating details given below. Avoid using citations in this section unless you provide information that does appear elsewhere on the page (this should be rare).\nFor all quantitative data, specify which measures are provided (e.g., mean, median, SD, or SE) or how a given measurement was taken (e.g., exposed culmen). Any number following a ± symbol needs to be specified as the SD or SE (e.g., 121.4 mm ± 1.02 SE). If this information is not reported in the original source, indicate that it is unspecified.\nVerify that any figures, media, and/or tables were prepared as per BOW standards (see Appendix 7).\n\nIf any part of the draft was previously published in another context, please obtain or ensure sharing permissions to republish it.\n\nCheck any link-outs in the text and remove any that are no longer functional.\nFollow American English conventions for spelling (e.g., “gray” instead of “grey”) and punctuation (e.g., use the serial or Oxford comma) (see Appendix 4).\nUse complete sentences of reasonable length to help make the account easy to read.\nRead over the draft for grammar, spelling, and referencing.\nFinalize a suggested author order (to be specified on the Draft Completion Form).\nVerify that all contributors have recently (within the last two years) signed and submitted a Contributor Agreement to BOW staff.\nFill out and submit the Draft Completion Form.",

    "section": "4. Política de revisión de fichas BOW",
    "text": "4. Política de revisión de fichas BOW\nBOW species accounts are living documents that require regular updates to maintain their scientific value and utility for conservation. While BOW respects the substantial effort that contributors invest to create and revise accounts, we must balance this with our mission to provide current, comprehensive information. This policy outlines how BOW editors will approach account revisions while maintaining fairness to contributors.\nIn general, accounts are revised when a need arises (e.g., the species is affected by the annual eBird/Clements Checklist taxonomic update), when part of the account is out of date (e.g., a change in conservation status), when an issue requires a fix (e.g., an account has a caveat statement incurred from an issue with one of more of its source projects), or when qualified contributors suggest or volunteer to make an update. \nWhen new contributors are in consideration to revise an account, BOW editors will encourage collaboration with previous authors when feasible, ensure fair attribution of new and retained content, and mediate discussions about authorship order.\nWhen a typical revision is contemplated, BOW editors will first contact all active contributors associated with that account using the communication method they indicated on the Contributor Information Form (English, Spanish). This initial contact from BOW editors will include the reason for the proposed revision, the options for participation, and if applicable, information about any potential new contributors and the expected timeline and scope of the update being proposed.\nActive contributors then have two weeks to decide whether they wish to lead or participate in the proposed revision. If no response is received within this time frame, BOW staff will proceed with the revision independently.\nFor those who do choose to participate, BOW staff will work diligently to develop a revision plan that attempts to accommodate all parties’ schedules and preferences. While we understand that quality revisions require significant time and effort, we ask active contributors to prioritize updates when needs or opportunities arise. Active contributors maintain the right to work independently of new contributors, provided they can address revision needs within a comparable time frame.\nWhile BOW editors will do their best to accommodate the wishes of active contributors for how and when accounts are revised, there are some extremely high priorities for revision that BOW would like to see updated as expediently as possible. These include species of special conservation concern, accounts with known issues (e.g., geographically imbalanced coverage or caveats), species with large publication records, and accounts that have not been revised for 10 years or more. If a given account is considered a “high priority” for revision, active contributors must come up with a revision plan that demonstrates steady progress at a minimum of 3-month intervals. If a contributor cannot abide by this schedule, BOW staff will bring in other qualified contributors to accelerate the timeline of the revision. Authorship will be awarded as per standard policies.\nBOW staff will endeavor to maintain open communication with active contributors; however, BOW staff may initiate revisions of accounts without contacting the previous authors if (1) an account lacks active contributors, (2) there is no meaningful progress or communication for one year following a proposed update, or (3) BOW staff decide to terminate a contributor’s involvement (typically due to unsatisfactory performance, agreement violations, excessive delays, or other inappropriate conduct).\nThis framework ensures that BOW maintains its scientific integrity and timeliness while respecting contributor efforts and fostering collaborative relationships within the ornithological community.",
